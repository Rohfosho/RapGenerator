Boolin' at the basketball game

Dressed in Balmain (Fresh)

Dropped a hundred on the whole thing

Inside cost a whole thing

And I'ma, give you my all, first my whole name

I'm in her mouth just like Colgate

I'm really feelin' super like, 8 (pyoo!)

Ay, hey, like or hate

Ladies man like bait

Hop inside a Bentley with a red paper plate

Every time they hate I throw them bands like a bouquet

I ain't Ray J but you can be my Kim K

Feelin' like Lil Flip, green on, like a cape

I'll never believe what Lil Kim say

Water like Phelps and you can jump in my lake

Running to my head like a deal in this league

Man, everywhere she go, she ballin'

Yeah she got xans, she like, "Where Tar at?"

She don't gangbang, she say she bang gangs

And she'll fight, might knock 'em out the ring

Out of cold Pepsi, she'll whip it like a waiter

I just wanna nut, she say that's easy like a baker

She just want a nigga, I don't serve but I love maple

And therefore she gon' watch me like cable



Take kare of her!

If I don't do nothin' in the world, swear to God I'll take kare of her

Take kare of lil mama, take kare of baby mama

Take kare of her

Take kare of her, take kare of her

Take kare of her



On a million, goin' to meet a billion

Brand new Bentley, you could keep the ceiling

Ooh! Take a trip to Peru, baby suck my dog like Snoop

Blood gang, big ups soo woo

Dinosaur bank roll, woo woo

H&M ballin',  hundred ten

Throw my boy 6, bim bim

Baby keep that pussy

Baby keep that pussy clean trimmed

Bought a castle with my last deal

Boy don't talk about no fast deal

Lil nigga you laaaaaaaaate, okay

I'ma put the pedal to the race

I'ma pull the pedal, not the brake

Ice inside my ring, you can skate

Yeah this shit cold like a case

That a nigga went and snitched, dealing with

All these mothafuckin' bitches

I'm the shit, girl, I'm the shit

I'ma build a hole for a snitch, not a ditch, shit



Mula, Mula



They be hatin' on my girl, though

And they wish they was the bitch they hatin'

Salutations to my old hoes

And thank you for your participation

No chaser for my girl though

She go harder than me on occasion

Gettin' wasted with my girl

Then we 69 'til we need ventilation

You don't know about it

Gotta open new accounts cause the others overcrowded

Gotta open up the stores when they're closed when we shoppin'

For my girl, wear the clothes that ain't nobody rockin'

She so bad, I don't know what to do with her

I know just what to do in her

Homies hit me up, they said they're goin' out tonight

I said I'm with my girl, tonight I can't fuck with you niggas

I'mma take kare of her
