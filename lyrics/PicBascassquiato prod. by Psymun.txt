Yo, just waking up

And I'm kind of sick

So here goes my best shit

My best try

My best attempt



Check it, I'm feeling like PicBascassquiato

And the clabber in thick ass match staccato

Strings, I look at the big mass and wonder

If I will be the nigga who spit ash and thunder at the same time

I guess not, I hit Psymun up for the beats

Twist the left knob, sweet

Now the head nod easin'

And no giving dick for a change

So you can't tell me that's not decent

And I ain't finna grub if the rest not eatin'

That's fam, looking to progress not feature

But if I'm in a rut, better bet I'll see you at 5

Bills eitherwise

Chill nigga, you just a villian in disguise

And ill till his death's last breath's to the sky

But he's still too depressed to accept compromise

So until then guess your best bet's step aside

Jive niggas
