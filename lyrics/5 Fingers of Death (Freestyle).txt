Jump up on my wee-wee

Oh oh, go jump up on my wee-wee

Fuck me on my ten speed

Gangsta of the century

Tell Rocky I want Iggy

This niggas getting rail road

Take yo' bitch ass to the nail shop

Ring ring from the gun shots

Brings her shoes back from the bailhop

This year from the gun loving, shit firin' and the migos

In supermax getting supermax with your hip gold and your nose ground

And I'm suicide to the children

I speak rhymes to the millions

All night won't sound like

Pitchfork, no website

All night, what's this like



Look at this here spitting

Nigga de-de-did it

Booyah, lil nigga gon' make me go double digits

Cause he dun murder up the block

My magnun go outta lock

My forty controlling your nina

Still on the wigg shot

When we had no pot to piss in

We would go plot the mission

Took me right out the mission

Took me right out the mission

Murder, mo murder, mo murder

Murder, mo murder, mo

But snitches they gotta go

Money, mo money, mo money

Money, mo money

Won't never stop

Body's on top of body's

Put bodys right under crops

These are my country tails

(Finger-mumbling-nials), hahahaa



Right off the top

Sorry MTV but I got to drop

I'm too damn ill

Nigga's can't fuck me I popped two pills

Baby where they did I go, they calling me Ali-

Greatest artist off all time

Condom on my forehead, condom on my fist

Oh, on my two fingers to

Why Sway cause I don't trust that bitch

Ey, eyes on low, buckethat to, yup Figgro

Been crippin' busting for minutes too

Cause I'mma a menace, been doing this shit

Five drunk Guiness, yah know what I'm sayin'

All off the top, I don't give a fuck

And I still ain't got a watch

Ashy on my knuckles with a thousand dollar ring

Thousand dollar shirt, Alexander McQueen

But I'm sorry that I diss it, real life

On serious XM, make you bitch to my BM
