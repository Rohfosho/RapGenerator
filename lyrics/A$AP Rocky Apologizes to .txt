A$AP Rocky is apologizing to NBA basketball player Jason Collins for his actions at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, which sparked rumors that he was homophobic
When the duo introduced Macklemore‘s performance of ‘Same Love’ during the awards show on Aug. 25, Rocky looked visibly uncomfortable around the openly-gay Collins, who made a speech about gay rights.
The A$AP Mob leader explained himself to The Stashed, detailing what happened that night
“I’m mad that my facial expressions was like that because I’m not homophobic at all, and that whole thing just came off real homophobic,” Rocky admits. “I didn’t really notice it until I got home and saw it. I apologize to Jason for that, because people was laughing and s-, and you know… I really don’t think that’s funny. I saw they were making all the memes and pictures and making fun of him.”
He also shared that he wasn’t too fond of MTV pairing him with Collins if he was going to be addressing the topic. “There’s people out there that think I was doing that to be funny, and truthfully I got gay people in my family,” Rocky states. “I don’t give a f- if you gay or you not, I just found it odd that MTV wanted to stand me next to this n- when they are talking about gay people, that’s all. You know what I’m saying?”
On the music front, A$AP Rocky and his A$AP Mob will debut a collaborative LP on Oct. 15. The project is currently untitled
