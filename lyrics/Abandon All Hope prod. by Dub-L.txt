Aesop Rock (Aesop Rock)



Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice

The factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and robes

Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe

Cenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this..



I carve a notch in my wall for every stall

Every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall

Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Mega-tron presence

Slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turned blood sport



Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company

Pumpin' out wise beads like, fly sneak-attacks on dry leaves dunced

Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'

Bad seeds blossom the wookie walk, hawkin'



Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find

The point at which repellent signals ultimately bind

When a pack of style mimics, see my brains target the cluster

I advance clutchin' the mic like, bully to knuckle duster



And a scent, your riddles yield a little plastic blend

Fuck a badge, light a bonfire dancin' jig around the pig

Figurin' yeah, I'll land a plane on bleached-stained trackers

Usin' only the finest and post-modern terrain mappers



Once my breath is dispersed

My God, you think the heaven's touched the earth then

Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse

But I don't, confide, wonder why to chose me

Bored, lasso down polaris, let the glow amuse me



Ok, I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies

Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes

It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell

Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning optics



Now someone's approached the rope, shakin' like snow-globes

Other sort safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (Yeah)

Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee

But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me



See, there's a time when... rhyme and...

Paint combined can't even manage to tell what the swell is like

Picture your imagery embellished

With the hellish aspects of the swarms' forlorn facets



Soul crafted fact cats, boroughin', left perennial tenants discouraged in

Discussin' my four seasons flourishing, uh!

Searching, perching, poetic lead poison

Poised in ploys to leak a little bit of moisture on your pride



I'm a animated style machine in

A "Veen"ing faulty production fueled by nicotine suction

From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden

You flash identify by the genus, species and class start to chuckle



Buckle the architecture til it fell through

Kill the survivors then raise the death for shock value

By the time the pending settlements' fully negotiated (yeah I'll...)

I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated



So like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like Boo Radley

Radically weak assume the colonel Kurtz in our platoon soon enough

That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher

Stuttering, emerging, gutter-urching, bursting



I live for the moment of truth when Big Willie rapper

Acknowledges failure and states "Goddamn my shit is trash"

"It's time to let go", the tin man bangin' upon his chest to hear the echo

Heartless kid, hollow compartments



Be we the people of the united, starving artistic

Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union

I'm cluing into the poison panoramics brew the panic situations

It fucks a little with my brittle gift



I tell myself "Stay" (Stay)... up high

Make a mockery of sun and moon and star 'till they hand over the sky

My de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is

Invade the town while village elders holler "Who the fuck's this?"



He hip a cats, aggravated trudge through the muds

Quickin' ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood

Rugged serpentines climb, pebble the rock

Let your pretty pink cloud nine expectations please you not



I'm, Ae-fuckin'-sop Rock, Mic Bizarro

Proper application of the soul by my standard

Candid once position from which instigations spawn

And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like...



Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope, it's like

Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope...
