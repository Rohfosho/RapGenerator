Swim in fallopians of Ethiopian women

The wheels are spinning, moon is glistening

Few exquisite, Now if you have witnessed

The youth is twisted, off purple liquid made to cure the sickness

Feel like my vision took a pitch shift

Smoking that Samson got me lifted

I'm the one who gave your girl cousin them drugs

Your little brother's plug, Spit inside your mother's mug

Take a finest bottle, pour the liquor out for em'

Once above, the last shot is for the homie's locked

Liqour crop, hit the lot, double spinning till the Guinness drop

Pull off in fourth gear, put it in park

The whores, they see me, say the lord's here

My voice is hoarse for them, pause there

Like over here, we don't support fear

Road to the riches, and the course clear

I'm riding till the tires sparking an exhaust tear



Actavis in cactus cooler

I bit the Apple on the Mac computer, you a loser

There ain't a subject I can't tackle, either now or sooner

Ain't got no shoulder pads, but collateral pass to her

Running back, running rap, I bet you wish she knew ya'

Black Lip Pastor, hallelujah (Soulo, Soulo)

Soulo in this ho, that mean this church up in this bitch

Gave her a sermon then I hit, god

I'm an entity into titties, a fat ass, some clean pussy, and some good weed

Knowledge and wisdom in abundance, infinite energy

And I'll be sure to write night and day, literally

Deadline snapback, Backwoods in my backpack

Xan with that lean nigga, shit you never seen nigga

Put that on my team nigga, 3 i's, you see me bruh

Careful, you know the game's T-D-E us



I heard they out there praying for the death of me

I been down to knock, it's my destiny

I been round the block, it's no testin' me

We been ran the north, it's no extra key

So whatchu' got on lock my nigga?

I tried to tell him, they ain't gon' get it

I been prolific, been on this shit

You can check mo millie, that was like 08's

You niggas ain't no factors, Just come around cause we ain't no actors

It's no scenes cut, just checks

Don't want 25, but I'll take my time

If a nigga come around, tryna' take what's mine

Tryna' take my life? good luck with that

We got guns for that, you not coming back

I got Fade in the bushes, lurkin' & lookin'

Bout' that life, don't get yours took quick

Just a story of some kids left stranded

Couple of the homies and a couple automatics

Come to the hood, get a good pack out

Tombstone RIP, with your hood whacked out

You know what he about, at Ramona Park till after dark

They drain they pool, we swam with sharks

We shooting fools off 7th street

You make the bed in which you sleep

I stay awake like visiting dead

With the hammer sitting indiscreet, in the streets



Sold drugs in your granny building

In front' the children

A piece of shit, I'll be considered the most

Baby hand on the dinner plate

I start the meal with a toast

Three assorted cheeses, then garnish them both

Cut the slices even

Distribute them to my assemblage of these fucking heathens

A bunch of demons in these polo fleeces

I clutch the reapers into bay polices

I burn the Priest and vanish in the breezes

I talk to Jesus, reconsidered features

Rain dance on black sanded beaches

Pick from the tree that bare the fruit of peaches

Slaying these skeezers and it feel the Eden

These backwoods got me with the heavy breathing

Connecting Venus and the shit the cheapest

I hit the party with the Sherm perm

Ear rings look like strobe lights

I cop the gold fish platforms for the cold price

Hop out the V in all sequence, fish is Swedish

Sway Padorian, my shit the meanest, you need it

And I'm the founder of this shit

On the forty-sixth floor eating flounder with the shrimp

Got a awfully thick splore and I just pound her with the dick

Get the dope from out abroad, destroy the county with the shit

Piece of shit records, where dreams come true

You saying fuck me? Nah fuck you
