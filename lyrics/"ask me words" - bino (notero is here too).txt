3. Which track is your favorite?



@ChildishGambino



I guess “oldest computer” mackelmore was supposed to be on it, but it became a little too house-y. then ms.banks came and made it a different song. it was cool to see



I never feel like everything’s done honestly



Urn

Spring? summer? fall? winter?



Did it have an effect on your songwriting/state of mind/et cetera?



Thnx



@ChildishGambino



I started Christmas day of last year. we were recording on this mountain above weather, so we weren’t cold unless we came down. I made it with winter in mind

@streetlights

@AKNC17



Sorry to get personal right away but people always ask basic ass questions in Q and A’s so here it goes



I know you were raised Jehovah’s Witness but do you still follow any type of religion?



@ChildishGambino



I don’t really believe in religion for myself. i’ve become spiritual, more at peace with things. but i don’t believe in god. not like that

@goochcrucible

@TheDarkKnight



What was the meaning behind the title of “Clapping for the Wrong Reasons”?



@ChildishGambino



Its a semi famous quote

@Robertf



Donald, can you explain the greatness of Sade’s debut album “Diamond Life.” I would appreciate a very detailed explanation of why Sade is so great and what she means to you as an artist. If you refuse to answer this question I will take it to mean you do not enjoy the musical styling of Sade….and as such you will draw my full ire

-22 y.o male who has just gotten heavily into Sade’s music



@ChildishGambino



I was literally listening to sade yesterday. she’s a world artist. and her music is just in tune with whatever vibration we all run on. I can’t answer a lot of your questions about her, all i can say is she’s a special artist/being

@MaxGertler



What does the ending of the last song symbolize? like that life can end at any second randomly?



@ChildishGambino



You should read the ‘because the internet’ script when it’s released

@CrookedModerator



If you could trade hairlines with another person, who would it be?



@ChildishGambino



They tell me i should fix my hairline cause i got money now



I ain’t gon sit around and front like i ain't thought about it



A perfect hairline is more appealing but it’s funny how



My shit is FUCKED UPPPPPPP but look how far i done got without it



I keep my HALF OF AN OCTAGON hairline fucked up just to show the kids it’s real

@Kid_Kamikazee



What did your followers realize at the end of The Biggest Troll?



@ChildishGambino



They realize “they don’t need a leader”

@Fran-Soul



Dude you are awesome love your music and my question is do you ever see your self touring Africa? coz that’s the only way I will ever see you unless you buy me a plane ticket to see you live in the US



Pliz respond



@ChildishGambino



I really wanna see africa. we were planning on south africa soon

@WiggityWackWes



1. There were huge jumps style-wise and sonically from Camp to Royalty to Because the Internet, do you see yourself developing a “signature sound” or do you plan on keeping things experimental and constantly trying new sounds?



2. Your music has helped me through a lot and continues to, so I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for what you do. Thank you!



@ChildishGambino



Thanks



I always wanna experiment. in everything. i’ll always try to push myself. i just never wanna be bored

@RayBeach



Do you make things that have or message or do you just let people interpret it? Kind of like 3005?



@ChildishGambino



I make things with messages for me in them. i hope they translate. sometimes they don’t, and that’s fine, but i usually just try to touch on something that’s intangible for me

@BasedGator



Question part: What inspires you when it comes to production? I hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album, which make sense since your from the south, but you didn’t really do that on Camp. Then you got something like ‘Zealots of Stockholm’ where it gets Death Grip-ish. Is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things?



Since your probably not going to see/respond to this, let me stan a little bit haha



Stan part: You are my role model, I can identify with your life and lyrics so well it’s crazy. I really hope in 10 years I can be as successful and well respected as you. I already liked your comedy and acting, but ever since I found out you rapped and I heard that E.E. Cummings line in ‘Freaks and Geeks’ I was hooked. Anyway, The new album is dope as heck, great work as always sir, and I can’t wait to see what you do in the future











@ChildishGambino



Ha. thanks



I try not to think to hard about what’s trap drums, what’s influenced by who’s hot now, and all that. i try to just find what feels honest. cause i don’t know if i’d wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone, but was no fun to make. this album, tho it came from a messy place, was by far the most fun to make

@SavvyRJA



It sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot? care to elaborate?



@ChildishGambino



To be honest, i don’t know much about him. i was always a beach boys dude over beatles. i learned a little about him through jhene

@SavvyRJA



Who is your favorite artist outside of Hip-Hop?



Perosnally, Gorillaz or Red Hot Chilli Peppers



@ChildishGambino



Anything by sam cooke

@griffinmahon



Do you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to full-length movies? Does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap?



@ChildishGambino



Short films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we don’t have a lot of time to spend. a short film, for me, leaves more to the audience, and doesn’t take so much time. And if it’s free, then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion

@Flowmatic



Whats your perspective on camp looking back at it now ?



@ChildishGambino



I love camp. it there’s little things i’d change, cause i know how music better, but yeah. i does what it’s supposed to do

@FlyTendencies



How do you sing so beautifully?



@ChildishGambino



That’s what you call it?

@A1_Day



Did My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus’s sound play a role in Because The Internet? How big of a influence is Kanye to you?



@ChildishGambino



I guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better? but honestly, his whole steez isn’t for me. I can’t do that. he just inspires me to be limitless

@StefanPonce



CAN YOU BREAK DOWN THE SONG TO “BOY BAND” ?!!!???!!!!



@ChildishGambino





@MYH



How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren’t real?



@ChildishGambino



Mirrors aren’t real

@Metron



What’s the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life? Did you explain the abrupt ending on Life: The Biggest Troll?



(I forgot to @ before cuz I was excited)



@ChildishGambino



I don’t feel like I’ve missed any opportunity, honestly

@GrizzyCreekwater

@Eon2323



Hey Donald, big fan here (actually #1 Gambino scholar here, but nbd). I have a couple of questions



1) Do you have a whole bunch of those white shirts or is it the same one?

2) Are you thinking about doing another comedy special in the near future?

3) What was your sister’s reaction to your fame and come up in the rap game?

4) Has Chevy Chase ever recited any of your lyrics or played any of your songs?

@AkonoMiles



My question to you childish is what advice do you have for all the creatives out there that work so much on polishing their craft. that surround themselves with all types of shit, music, art, etc and try as much to absorb to than emit that knowledge into their work. what advice do you have childish cause sometimes i be feeling like im going nowhere. especially seeing others who do what i do get further than me when their ideas are really nothing but regurgetated shit we’ve all seen. i just feel like im going crazy sometimes yo. haha. thanks — akono



@ChildishGambino



Yeah. i think you have just look at what y o u really want. it can be frustrating. but u also have to know how people work and what people want from you



You should read “mastery” by robert greene

@ChildishGambino



Cool. i have some work to do



Thanks for the questions. rap genius is a dope place. cool to see you guys taking such good care of it
