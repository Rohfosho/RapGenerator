[Verse 1: J. Cole]

Yea, look niggas want to know the formula for success
Shit, but I studied for this test
Ay nigga Im better than the rest
You just rest, boy please!
Me im trynna stretch my treasure chest like some double D breast
So a nigga on a quest no question, so I tell them birds no nesting
Laying in my bed hope to lay a niggas egg
No- youll never hatch mine
Baby, you dont match mine
Im trynna shine like the bat sign
When its crime and the gats flyin
Up in Gotham watch em
Far from a thug but Ill drop one
Far from a scrub but Ill mop them
Watch them better leave them alone like Stockton
When he retired, shit your shit is fire boy stop
I dont buy it, boy caught, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
Its not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants-ha!
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Dont want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up
Thats cold blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here you can make if from heaven to hell
Im just a little nigga strait out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blew with more rhymes due
Nigga you trying who?
Shit, nigga you tryning me bitch im better than all them niggas you trynna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch Im better than all them niggas you trynna be
Look, its no time to chill Im trynna get mills
Theres not time to chill im trynna build
Bitch theres no time to chill Im trynna get mills
Theres not time to chill im trynna build
Its no time to chill Im trynna get mills
Theres not time to chill im trynna build
Bitch its no time to chill nigga! Yep
