NOT FINISHED YET, PLEASE ADD MORE LYRICS AND CORRECT THE ONES THAT ARE WRONG
Yo
I'm a firebreathing dragon
Exhaling too much smoke so my body is staggering, lagging
Like a fat bitch when she sees a table full of snacks
Snickers bars, Skittles, Paydays and Kit-Kats
You try to look down on me but I have the shit that you lack
And my flow is Naginski plus my swagger is classy
Walk down the street but my journey is protracted
As a matter of fact bitch , I'm a hobo on Saturdays
I've smoked weed, but I want to try crack
So I can get addicted to it with the first practice
Get slapped by a girl and pop her back like elastic
Bitch I'm rape, you're just sexual harassment
Sick like a fucking premature calf born in the winter near the polar ice caps
I cut off the high, but first I had to stab it
Like I had a butcher knife and a rubber halloween mask
I am Isaac Newton
If you fumble with my balls then there's no going back
You can touch on one and cause a chain reaction
We can play a sex game as long as it's satisfactory
You can live in my hobo dystopia and you don't even have to ask me
But if you do you're digging yourself a starvation casket
Cause this life is for the fallen, not those with flower baskets
My bed is a bench, my pillow is grass
Guys play the pranks so my cover has tacks in it and
Dinner is always leftovers, feed them from the trash
An eight of butterfingers and a half eaten catfish
Swag us the fuck out we're (?) and
The NÃ¼ Age (?) and teenage anarchy
Yo, our flows are so beast they could slice a grain of
Sand in half, with their two front teeth
Swag
