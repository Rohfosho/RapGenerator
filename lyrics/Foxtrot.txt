I had my heart in my cap
So you must own every beanie, every strapback
Every top hat, every fitted, every snapback
They all belong to me, but i don't even want half back
It's been a couple months, and I done seen a couple flashbacks
If i said I got a half, then say, "Alright, babe, i'll match that"
I type it in on twitter, Foxtrot, as a hashtag
When i make it, i promise, that i will be blowing fat stacks
And my friends think I'm Bitchmade
Cause i would rather chill with you, out of school, on the skip days
But your'e not a bitch, and i really think that it's great
I know we'll be there for each other, especially on the sick days
I used to think it was hard to be poetic, but
Now i realize, that the sun could never set, when
I'm with you, cause I'm gone, keep trying 'till we're wedded
And don't think I'm lying, cause i would probably die if we were separate
Spark a couple B's and hit the sheets, to relieve some stress, and
Go to the movies, and just enjoy each others presence
Being with you is like, we just left and went to heaven
Give you couple G's just to show you a little (?)
And i just love being your man
After we're done in bed, I could get up to make the Sandwiches
Or, we could go out to eat, because then i could hold your hand and
We can head down to the beach and write our names in the sand
I know you don't do it much, but i can teach you how to dance
The foxtrot, I'm dreaming of us prancing in our mansion
Relaxing with our Fam, or me messing with the animals
I love you, and i just really want you to understand it
I had my heart in my wallet
You already know, if you need it and i got it, it's yours
I drop down to one knee and in my pocket it's stored
A nice diamond ring and a locket it's for
Your neck and your finger, cause i adore that
Dimple, when your'e smiling and something about these whores, that
Makes me start writing on what we have formed, I
Know that there might be a storm in store, but
Guess what, yea we both mess up, when a tests up, we fess up and let these bygones be the lesson
Because I'm dressed up for you
I have the best luck in School
And I'm glad you always listen, because a confession takes two
As soon as i saw you i knew that a first impression was due
I have too many errors, but the correction is you
Your nothing less than perfection
That's my obssession, it's true
It's been my life test, and i accept it, it's cool
He fucked it up and ruined it
So i came in a fixed you up like Lunapic
Us against the world, us two forever, don't you forget
We could go on a rooftop and fuck you in unison
I hate to brag, but you should know your'e with the smoothest kid
You say you wanna chill, well i'll head over and bring smoothies with
I'm feeling like an emperor, you put me back into my groove again
I Love you, you know it and i never want to lose you or this
