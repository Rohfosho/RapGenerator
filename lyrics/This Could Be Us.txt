Full lyrics coming on January 6th, 2015

...Lie to me

Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything

Sex on the beach and in the backseat

This could be us



So back to what I was saying (money make the world go 'round)

This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)

This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)

I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy (money make the girl go down)

Fuck what them niggas was saying (money make the world go 'round)

This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)

This could be us...
