Trippy Nation nigga. Young Ced on the beat. Watch these snitches mane
These nigga's dropping dimes, they some real snitches
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause
All that point in talkin' ain’t allowed where I’m from X 2
Nigga stuck off in the fare, fucking with them bricks
His partners put them laws on him, over a bitch
These pussy nigga's scared, don’t wanna take they charge
They swear they hard but they softer then cotton balls (ho)
Real nigga's go to jail and don’t tell them nothing (true)
Do that time, come back home then get back to hustling (true)
We got everything for sale, but the kitchen sink (true)
Keep my eyes on you snakes, I don’t even blink (bitch)
Boy you scared, you gonna tell them white folks everything (yes sir)
To cut your time, you gonna give up errybody name (pussy)
Snitching nigga you ain’t straight, them folks gonna find you dead
Cut your tongue out your mouth and put one in ya head
These nigga's dropping dimes, they some real snitches
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause
All that point in talkin' ain’t allowed where I’m from X 2
The bigger the gun, the bigger the slug
The bigger the hole for doc to plug
Holdin' your head, I put you to sleep
Body not found, mama gon’ weep
Droppin the dime, an runnin your mouth
Nowhere to run, down in the south, meet ya
Wrong, I hop on the phone, goons on route
Burners out, you screamin'
Pig, I blow up your wig, vocals smokin' jet
Like a cig, blowin' on kush and sippin'
On hen, Forgive me father for your sin, meet
Ya wrong, I'm able again, convicted felon
Back in the pen, pistol in face, you wit a tin-chin
They goin' for twelve, I got em for ten
He threw me them boos, he knew I'm a boss, he looking for bread
He know that’s a loss, I cross em a corn, mixed somethin' me deal
An separate the fact from the real, you play the cards, bet you a deal
Behind them bars, now you gon’ squeal, you playin'
These streets, we playin' for real, jail come wit it
Swallow that meal
These nigga's dropping dimes, they some real snitches
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause
All that point in talkin' ain’t allowed where I’m from X 2
Prime time snitchin' lies, got line twistin' guys
Take the clip to make them flake no bind side or district 9
Trying to dodge prison time, all die for fishin' by, smith and 9's (pow pow pow)
If you mention mines, One. put you in a scope, Two. clack then it's smoke
(gun shot) Three. scoop you up and put ya body in a envelope
Four. send yo folks jus ya head chest, guts, now you leakin' body stinkin' up the Fed Ex truck
And that fed pressure, makes the snitches wanna roast you
They start droppin dimes like they coins miss the toll booth
God as my witness man I swear to tell the whole truth
Where I'm from we gets it done and act like we don't know dude
These nigga's dropping dimes, they some real snitches
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues, cause
All that point in talking ain’t allowed where I’m from X 2
