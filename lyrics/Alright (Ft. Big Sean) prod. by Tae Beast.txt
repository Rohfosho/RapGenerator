Hold up, let me get my mind right

Let me get my mind right

You know everything is alright

You know everything is all



Just ride with a mothafucka

Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucker hold me down

Chillin' in a-gadda-da-vida, rockin' Adidas

With a senorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter

That's royalty, like the homie Gambino

He know we be in the casino lightin' Cubans with a C-note

I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido

Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito whenever I step on the beat, ho

Like a killer on the creep slow

Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho

While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though

Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off

Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with the sawed off

Blowin' up like a molotov

This is war everybody ain’t no reason I'ma call it off

Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright

In the studio everyday so you know this shit about to be a busy night

Everything is all, everything is alright



It's finally famous over everything

Rattpack gang

What up though Logic, yeah

Day one shit right there





Oh my God they plottin' and schemin'

Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'

They tryna take my blessins away

They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday

And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well

On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'

And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy

But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'

Got champagne problems, and I order more my wardrobe is Aura Gold

I'm a young nigga with a older soul

But still young enough to know I gotta know some more

I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician

She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician

She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up

Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up

Hype nigga back-back-back it up

Claimin' that we homies, boy stop

That's the type of shit I boycott

Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops

Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts

I got these good girls hoin' out

Tell me what the fuck you know about

Bein' that nigga that these niggas dont know about

Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out

Now everything is alright





Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off ‘em

Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin

Im coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane

Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' cause I'm into the game

Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same

All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela

Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella

Ain't nobody better do it like me

I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me

Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace

No need to keep a piece

I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?

And keep it real for the people I reach!
