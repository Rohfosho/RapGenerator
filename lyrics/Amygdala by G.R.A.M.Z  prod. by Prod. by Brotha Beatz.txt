Yes sir

I been under pressure

And the way I feel

Any day I'm bound to break

Pull that pound and gester

Yes sir

Yes sir

Ur wildest dreams can't measure

To nightmares and the day terrors

That's reaccured since my birth

No sir

Wut worse

Is my father told me I'm cursed

And all the drama he's caused

Is only gonna trickle down to my spawn

But wait its gets worst

I'm the kin of killers and jerks

Kin of Dope addicts and alcoholics

Shit I been drinkin since 12

Night train 40

I was born to thug it I kno

Can't live wit out it

I'm the living product

Of struggle, muscle,hustle

My pain

My hope

Is to make it outta this hole

And I'm almost reachin my goal

To leave a lil something Malcolm can own

Get grown

Get grown
