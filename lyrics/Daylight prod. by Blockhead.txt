Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop

And keep on, 'till the break of dawn



Put one up for Shackle Me Not, clean logic procreation

I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent

While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement

I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience

Y'all catch a thirty second flash visual

Dirty cooperative med platoon, bloom, head-trip split ridiculous

Fathom the splicing of first generation fuck up

With trickle down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)

I pace me game for zero hour completion cretin, splash

Duke of early retirement picket dream

American Nightmare hogging the screen

I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in

If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym

Now it's honor and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage

Merit crutched on the wretched refuse from my teeming resonance

I promise temperance towards breed with a leaning conscious

See, the creed accents responsive but my spores divorced the wattage

And I'm sleeping now (Wow!) Yeah, the settlers laugh

You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash

You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags

You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs

(You won't be laughing!) Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed

So I triple knot them then I forgot them

His origami dream is beautiful, but man, those wings will never leave the ground

Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down



All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day

Put the pieces back together my way



Slacker-bound imitated tabloid headline with a pulse

Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed

Divvy crumbs for the better souls with seven deadly stains

Adhere the blame to crystal conscience

The result's a lowlife counting on one hand what he's accomplished

Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep

Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon

I hock spores coursed by the morbid spreading of mad men, Alley gospel

Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle

I could zig zag and zig em again for the badge dreams

Sparkle in my brick wall windows another thick installment

Of one night in Gotham without the wretched

Houston we have a problem

Attached to the festive batch of city goblins

Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow

Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow

Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus

Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering

Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman

You only call her a bitch because she won't let you get that pussy

Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests

Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess

Kiss the speaker wire Peter - Pacifism pagan thresh hold

Stomach full of halo kibbles, wings span cast black upon vigils

Hear the Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels

I got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace

You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast

Metal Captain

This cat is asking if I've seen his bit of lost passion

I told him: "Yeah," but only when I pedaled past him
