Hey ya'll, I came to talk about
This girl that had my love
You see, I went away for a while
She gave my love away
And I really shouldn’t blame her
But now that pussy is a stranger
Baby, something's on my mind I gotta say it
Yeah, Your pussy done changed
It ain't the same girl and thats a shame (A crying shame baby)
Ooh, ain't being funny
I know another bee’s been in that honey
Ooh, baby, that pussy done changed (Done changed)
It’s such a shame (Done changed) girl and that's a shame
Who the hell you been giving my loving to girl?
Oh, no
Tell me where that pussy gone (Oh, no)
Cause it don’t feel the same no more
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no (Why you do me like that baby?)
Oh, no
Why is that happening to me (Oh, no)
She told me that it was my pussy
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
She, she used to be a really special lady (My everything)
I guess she’s feeling kinda freaky lately
It’s such a shame cause now the pussy’s changed (That pussy changed, yeah)
She used to squeeze me
Grip me tight enough so she can please me
But now-now-now, that pussy changed (Pussy done changed)
It’s such a shame (Pussy done changed), that pussy changed
Oh, no
Where did ya pussy go? (Oh, no)
Cause girl, I need to know
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no
You see, it was on some old one-of-a-kind type shit baby (Oh, no)
I’m about to kill this bitch (Oh, no)
She gave away all my shit
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Damn, darlin', do change your oil
I’m your number one fan-belt, they are not important
I don’t use a cordless, microphone avoid 'em
They don’t feel real to me
Meaning real woman
Others peeled on me
You the primer on the lime bean green box
When I couldn’t afford a Ford
Clean socks scooting 'cross the floor
In your, grandmama house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the Penny-Ante
This mechanic's so uncanny
X-Men, X-Men
Your ex-boyfriend should thank me that I took you off his hands
Know I can bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please but
Can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they gone put this man’s Grammy’s on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happen in a Hyatt
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker
You think I don’t remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don’t even know got you in bed
Bet your buddy don't even know you don’t like red
Or was it fuchsia, fuck it, our future is dead
Oh, no (I thought a pussy cat had 9 lives man) I need to know
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no (That pussy)
Oh, no
I'm about to kill this bitch (Oh, no)
She gave away all my shit
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I miss ya girl
(Fuck dat bitch!)
