Remix baby, remix baby



Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance

All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands

Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance

These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands



Montana!

Bands a make her dance

20's make her glance, 50's make her flip

100's make her give me head (head)

Cheeks clappin', she don't use no hands

All this pussy poppin', I'm just poppin' bands

I just pay the mortgage, I just pay note

Hurricane Katrina, bitch you need a boat

Bitch you need to float

Show me what your twerking with

20 bottles,30 moddels,40 burners bitch!



She like what the fuck is a dollar bill

Ass pound like impolo wheels

3 wheel motion, grip and grain

Fuck the motion just get the change

I don't know what you thinking man

I take your money and get the brain

Them other bitches ain't build the same

He say you can't be real who buildt your frame

Ever seen a stripper got right left

Make it really wanna go pipe that

But you ain't really gonna like that

She fuck your brain, no mike check

Money... bet you brake it off

You see that ass, you see that cash best you take it off like..





I Brought some bands so won't you dance

Throw a stack on 2 hands

Another stack now that's 2 bands

Brought a friend now that's 2 fans

Gettin' trippy now that's 2 xans

Double that now that's 4 bands

Juicy J he got more bands

Trappin' hard like snow man

Smokin' loud another grown man

Been gettin' money since a young nigga

But they respect me now couse I'm a grown man (uh)

Condo by the ocean, forgot my watch now that's a Rolex

Hit the strip club, and spend more bread

And spill champenge on her for head

Smokin' and sippin, I'm talkin' that rich shit hoppin' that broke niggas listen

Shorty keep poppin' it strippin I got to reach in to my pockets keep tippin

Seen her with the team, that's my bands chick

Got rich off the internet so it's safe to say that's my band width





Bands a make her dance

It'll make that ass go hammer

It'll get her heels high for the sky

It'll make the 2 lips kiss the floor when she land (Damn)

That outta do it, if I'm with a bitch then she probetly hood

Gin on the rocks gone off the kush

Gone off the bean she in mollywood

She dance for my Bands like it's home comming

She ain't working gettin' money, she ad home comming

I stake the facts, I brake her back if I drop a grip like it's snow money

I see broke niggas watching, cause they ain't got no paint

It's a lot of niggas saving hoes but Bobby Ray can't

I say whats going broke can y'all reminds us

Lost in the money can't y'all finds us

Tosh and Nicole sliddin' on a pole

Booty going dumb like Alzheimer

I say what's going broke please y'all remind us

Self made niggas no Cole sign us

Tosh and Nicole sliddin' down a pole

Booty going dumb like Alzheimer





That tell her, bad bitches, paid niggas, they love me

Strip a ho, mad women, I be well with her bubby

Met a girl named porsche, with a sound ass like a horse

In V.I.P, at KOD, enroll for an inner course

Twerking for bandz, I be on xan

She gon' keep popping them racks on your hands

Juicy stay making it rain in the club

And I ain't leaving till that bitch flood

Rolling like it's nothing and I don't give a damn

I would say no to ratchet pussy but I just don't think I can

In the streets, with a stripper sipping lean and tweakin'

Pop molly and that ass bout to get freaky

Gotta get some brain man and see what she thinkin'

Shawty don't spit, she like to keep it

White girls that oxy, I roll back in that KK

Gotta major bread like Mitt Romney

Fuck making it rain a tsunami



Bands a make her dance
