[Intro]
1, 2, 3: go!

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sho
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank god for mom and dad
For sticking through together
Cause we don't know how

[Hook]
Hey ya!

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all
We've been together
Oh, we've been together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes - then what makes
Love the exception?
So why oh why
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

[Hook]

Uh-oh!
Don't want to meet your daddy
Just want you in my Caddy
Don't want to meet your mama
Just want to make you cumma
I'm just being honest!

[Bridge]
Hey, alright now
Alright now fellas (Yeah!)
Now what's cooler than being cool?
(Ice cold!) I can't hear ya
I say what's cooler than being cool?
(Ice cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright.. OK: now ladies
(Yeah?)
We're gonna break this back down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor! Ah, here we go!
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now all the Beyonce's and Lucy Lius
And babydolls, get on the floor
(Get on the floor)
You know what to do
Oh, you know what to do!
