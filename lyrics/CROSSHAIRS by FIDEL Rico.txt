(1st verse)
Got expelled from high school so now I go from 3 to 6
(why?) They caught me doing evil shit
Those fuckers can eat a dick and lick a fucking dirty fetus clit
I'm spitting genius shit
You in the drought?
All you gotta do is hit the beeper kid
9 on my waist if you actin up then I'mma reach for it
Bring you back to life and set you on fire for the sequel bitch
The potent rolling, diesel smoking, Third eye open villain is grillin
With intentions of killing you in your childrens swimming pool
Fuck your feelings, rip your fillings out (Oh) with an eager pull
I'm keeping cool, while your still in school fucking repeating rules
Just to play the fool in a lost society with no variety
There ain't no good side to me you better open up your third eye and see
(Hook)
Money over bitches
Power over riches
They told us not to do drugs but clearly I wasn't listening
Smoke some piff with Piffy
(Why you mother fuckers in my cross hairs)x2
(2nd verse)
Cross hairs aiming at your dome
Get to spraying like cologne
Then toss the self destructive phone right inside of your mothers home
She gripped my bone, I hit she moaned
Hit the bong then roll a cone
I'm in my zone, on the throne chuggin vodka
Poppin aspren
Trippin off acid in Aspen till I can see the ass spin
(Why they hating on you?)
I don't know but you should ask them
Hating fucks who claim we suck, we ballin like Blake Griffin
Plus every night I got a different slut who's down to fuck and bust them nuts
Rico be that physco fuck, throwing street fighter uppercuts
Till it's fuckin up they chuck
