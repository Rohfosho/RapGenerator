Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE

I don't give a fuck about no one except me

Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE

I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean



I'm smokin' double pack, Louis duffel bag, get that money stack

Trouble's back, I don't give a fuck we jump out the back, where they at?

We leave all essentials in a zig-zag

Roll it up, take a drag, I'm the best at it, I don't like to brag, Leave my body in a bag

If you fuck around you in that body bag, burn the flag

Fuck who you know I don't fuck with that

Couple zeros on a couple tags

Tunnel vision, tunnelin' a jag

Stumble out the hotel lobby

Shoveled gold knuckles, screaming where they at?

I won't be in your life again but you might see me in a mag

Delete my number, never call me back

Flat on the ground spat blood on my Acronym bag

We from Stocktown, seasons change

Bitch you know where we at





Let's get real, land of the ghost, so trill

Come and take a trip in my hill, get ghost

Don't come up here with that shit, get roast

Know LaFlame don't play by his toast, you know

And I'm bound to flow you down, come on, she grab my jeans

She grab the kush, she balancing on my balance beam

While i'm jigglin' cantaloupes

We off that lean, lean, lean in my dream, dream, dream, dreams

We don't want alcohol drinks, only soda and codeine

Get it right, get it right

It ain't down for the night, it ain't down for the night

A-yo yo yo Lean where these bitches come from

Tryna' see who with the shits, who really down to get drunk

I might throw up, might turn up, turn up of every summer

Every summer, every summer, every summer



I'm with sad boys in Stockholm they know H-town be my home

They know H-Town be my home

Them, them my homies, them, them my homies

I'm with Sad Boys in Stockholm

They know Mo City my home

Them them my homies, them them my homies

Them them my motherfucking homies

(Straight up)
