Wolves out, baby
My barrel lean like thorazine
Like Reverend King, cream like Medell√≠n
Cartel spark reel, y'all in the mezzanine
Swimming at the shot ball, shot ball, guillotine
A hundred on the dot balls, dark on the big machine
Blowing at your entourage, old squad, wolverines
Camouflage dons, spits hella steam, prophesize, we monopolize
Gotta get the green
Backs in my nap sack, roll up a swisher, sweet, light a spliff, life's a bitch
Freaking off with the team, off the shit I've seen, probably should be dead now
Fuck the zombies, smoke the bong, it's weed to the head now
It's the semi-auto blowing through your audio
My niggas press you and leave you in the poorest mode
Known movements, it's reality music, the gun law is; if you got one, you better use it
Listen, they pit convos, see your way out before D jump over E
And F you up like a G so play silly, feel a 9 milly
Acting like you 'bout this life beef for really
Face fighting, wanna steal, y'all niggas kill me
Deer gang, 215, it's Gucci Philly, it's Louis Loaf with the smoke that beats that
Camouflage dons, Zombies, Statik Selekt
We present shots, we blowing off limbs
No sublimes, don't get it twisted, we knock them
It's a new wave, NWA, trick it how you want it, and it's all I got to say
The fame ain't changed me, I still don't fuck with you, niggas
I still be on the streets, I still scream fuck religion
I ain't scared of beef, get beef, put on a skillet
You bigots are non-existent so fuck all my competition, hold up
Hoes haze, no competition, your mortal vision is sacrilegious
Painting vivid pictures, smoking with the same niggas
It's Montana flow, whiter than the white cops that shot the kid on my block
I'm from a place where we want it, we take it
Gold teeth, two foes
Trap it in the basement
Two freaks, one Meech, it's threesomes in the AM
Take a whiff, fold shit, four blunts in one bash
Bodies in the basement
Homicide cases?
Prophesize about multiplying pot like we makers
Hater, you ain't on like the Lakers
I know I'm wrong but we don't go, got this slave shit
Smif-n-Wesson, one bullet
Your pick
Third leg, I be putting it in your bitch
Robbing like Life After Death had a fourth disk
Rhyme like all eyes on me times four shit
Park place, sheet pins, smoking at the ball games
Scot bucks up top only when the Knicks play
Before you cross a dead motherfucker, look both ways
Motherfucker, look both ways
Motherfucker, look both ways
Camouflage dons, camouflage dons
