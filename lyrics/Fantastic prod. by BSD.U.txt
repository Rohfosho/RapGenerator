I'm with my niggas, we see these whores funny
Life ain't a walk on the beach even if the floors sunny
Niggas need more money, see I did it on my lone tip
Trying to sneak some credit, that's some shit I don't condone with
Wash away my own sins, want it done right?
Gotta do it on your own then on the darkest night like
It's a ritual, and I'm a demon
Just hiding in the subliminals but only for the meantime
I'm from the future, so I know you ain't ahead of me
Strategically defeat as I triangulate trajectory
So, you see why still no one is next to me, right?
Probably in a league from beyond
But my pride is in the wind, so my chivalry is gone
The end is near, I can feel it in my palms
Reinstate it like a mystic in the song
Life is war, so when isn't the winner armed?
