The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

Oh, haha, oh!

Oh, haha, oh!



Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me

Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty

East side, wild city; got my block with me

Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny

In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches

Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)

Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins

Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends

Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us

Careful around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper

All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa

Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us

Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus

Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us

Bring the word like a preacher

Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people



In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo

I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas

And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto



They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa

When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go

Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo

West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know

Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner

I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana

With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it



Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love

What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs

It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums

Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock

I gotta make it out cause nobody else will

And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)



You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)

Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)

Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows

Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)

Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt

Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods

Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood

(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug



Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me

I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid

In full, like ace till momma's straight

And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight

Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it

Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it

Cause you might need it, more than I

All My Life Remix, brought to you by:





This what you doing for town, huh Rock

Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up

All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this



No Rocka-fella had me pissed off

Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss

Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross

Scream "New West" had everybody pounding

Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it

Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz

Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh



I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail

Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale

You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail

Go to hell, i got records to sell

Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese

I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze

Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees



I came in this game with a dollar and a dream

My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets

But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast

I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"

And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats



Long Beach, California, the sinos de Watts



I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store

And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store

I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though

Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow

And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause

I was right there at that corner store

I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow

I even had cream, like Rocky Road

I thought getting out the hood was impossible

That's all I know, I ain't that responsible

So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical

And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles

All of a sudden, this rap got popping though

Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll

Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note

If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!



Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap

Got the black bandana with the strap to match

Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go

As I rock throwback like the huxtables

Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack

We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that

You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff

Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine



I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife

I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights

My whip lean, my shoes clean

Diamond watch, low-key

All sip, mint green

Doing my thing, in the fast lane man

I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it



(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?

I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain

I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone

Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm

Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all

Look like new waves but I' stuck them home

Niggas want to creep when they think you on

So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!





(I feel you Jay)

I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work

Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp

And even though I moved a little  work

I still suited up for a Sunday at Church

Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks

This day and night though, I know it ain't right

But down in the hood, man, this is our life



I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me

My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'

Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin

And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water





Product of the block, young rider from the block

In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job

We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing

Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis

I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy



Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping

What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?

I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man

You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane

You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside





Listen to the pain of a real crack baby

My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby

Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed

So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present

My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope

My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke

In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!

Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!



Came from nothing, rose from slums

Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London

Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling

End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em

God damn, I'm a good ass rapper

Half these wack rappers is some good actors

Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta

But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit
