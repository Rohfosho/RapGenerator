[Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Careful around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, [?] was at me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
[?]
Long Beach, California, the sinos de Watts
[Spanish]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook]
