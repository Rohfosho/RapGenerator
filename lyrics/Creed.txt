I see you just got the Marauder sig
This flow is dirt, reminiscent of how they slaughter pigs
Nasty, claim he in it for the craft
But the whole land know he only in it for the cash
So wicked, flip (?), and just last week
Dude was on the news, best villain since Mad V
Black slacks, Devillain tee, and some rad sneaks
Circque of ?, maybe Vans, maybe Adis
Time's running out, sit back, enjoy the last trees
Puff herbs, we collapse, relax, giving dabs, sweet
The bad part's we do attack
Sweep villages, squadron hella militant, don't ask me
The reasons cause I don't really know 'em
Captain said just have fun before the show's done
But I suggest you run down it if the road comes
Cause word around town is the shogun shows guns
And he don't like you, word is you're a spy who
Works undercover for the unknown side
With the ogre from the high boons, but do you spice food?
Cause blood is eye food, gouge out his eyes, goons
I'm just kidding
That was the last test and I guess you've permitted, it's rigid
But surely you can fit in, you're still not promoted
You want it, gotta show it, didn't roll it
Just know it's only gas that you smoking but confidence
Never trust a soul and we always question optimists
This clan is the opposite of moral, so just follow the creed
Being mad ruthless gets you to the spot upon the steed and
From the jump, you know that what we do is grotesque
So if you got a problem, go and burn it with the Smoke Vet
Down to hell, where good deeds are in protest
Villain of the creed, yes siree, you just professed
Creed
