Yes sir, yes sir, I been under pressure

And the way I feel, any day I'm bound to break, pull that pound and gesture

Yes sir, yes sir, your wildest dreams can't measure

To the nightmares and them day terrors, that's reoccurred since my birth

No sir, what's worse, is my father told me I'm cursed

And all the drama he's caused, is only gonna trickle down to my spawn

But wait, it gets worse, I'm the kin of killers and jerks

Kin of dope addicts and alcoholics, shit I been drinking since 12

Night train, 4-0

I was born to thug it, I know

Can't live without it, I'm a living product, of the struggle, muscle, hustle

My pain, my hope, is to make it out of this hole

And I'm almost reaching my goal, to leave a little something Malcolm can own

Get grown, get grown



I don't even sleep inside my bed

Sick of all these dreams inside my head x4



Go to sleep, wake up, then crack a brew

Think about all the fuck shit I been through x3



Cause the dreams that a nigga be having at night, shit

Not to be fucked with



Y’all ain't raw , it ain't hard to tell ya stepped on

Zombie try we, in the back of my mind

This kush so good, rewind the time

I'm still on my grind, I'm still selling packs

I don't get shit for this fucking rap

So fuck you and your bullshit

I don't got time for your foolishness

I mean shit, I do miss my momma

And my daddy, never had thee

But I’m gladly, M.I.C yes, he loves me

Tired of running from the police

And you fuck ass niggas don't know me

And you ain't even a percent of the old me (ol' me)

So I smoke good to this O.E

Beat the pussy good, so she love me

I sold pussy, sold drugs

But ain't never gonna sell my soul cuz

Look out for the nigga on the corner with a Glock

And his pants with a sack full of raw

With his back to the wall

Smoking packs of Newport's

His daddy in a hole he ain't got no remorse

Yeah



Money be the motive, watch me make this money multiply

Master of my flow making murderous music my god

My momma make sure my hopes is high and I aim for the sky

My mind's a supercomputer that never ever haywire's

Speaking of hay, I'm the thinnest needle in the middle of it all

I'm like ads, so see, you'll only find me if I'm meant for ya'll

God damn it, ain't it amazing, we done came a long way from slave ships

Even though we still on our whips and chains shit

Will I shine bright cause I bear the light or will I sink in the abyss

It ain't sinning if you winning and I'm living proof of this

More like dead proof, you bitch

Done seen a zillion rappers come up and ain't do shit

Maybe cause his mainframe was the same as his

Faker than the chest of these porno actresses

Hold up, let me hit this spliff, I'm known for spitting sick

Rolling up and talking shit, Zombie gang, Flatbush bitch

You know what it is
