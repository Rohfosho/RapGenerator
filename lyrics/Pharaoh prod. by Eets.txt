All black, pharaoh shit, golden scarab shit
Feel the vibration so deep that my bone marrow twitch
Can tell he awesome by the hair he with
Or his scary wit, turn oxygen to water
But just log it into narratives, populace is docile
Soldiers fall into the barren field of logic like
"Just wait for the fog and hope the air will clear"  Dumbest shit I'll ever hear
Dumb it down so I don't come off a verbal grenadier
Locked inside the mental sphere, so see the end is near
[?]
No? So don't ask me for forgiveness
Moved in with my niggas, turned my khakis in for swimmers, boy
