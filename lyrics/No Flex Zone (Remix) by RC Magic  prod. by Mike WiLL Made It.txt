(Verse)
In this zone we say no flex
Work lyrics out like Bo Flex
All of my haters gonna protest
But I don't got time for em lost my Rolex
In terms of pussy, i'm doing Sphinx
Anywhere I go wear Cuban Links
Cause I don't fuck with a necklace
Still living young and reckless
I don't slang no cocaine
All i'm slaying is pootang
Yo bitch has been hijacked
And now shes all on my sack
Gotta have that glory
Its so mandatory
I am raps Jerry Jones
I kill the beat and then I bury bones
Money rotates clockwise
You can't say these thots wise
Who would make these thots wives?
My skills be making my spot rise
Hit you with this verse with style
To let you know that i'm versatile
And would say I got the best flow
But like i said this a No Flex Zone
Yeah
