[Intro:Biggie Smalls]

Ready nigga? Ready for that raw dog shit nigga?
Okay,Alright
Let me see how im gonna hit you with
You wanna set it off?

[Verse 1: 2pac]

I'm scared to do some freestyle
Flow
I'm too high
And I might go of tempo
But now I'm back to let these niggas know just how
Deep
My game run
2Pacalypse don't sleep
I keep a motherfucking Glock in my car if I'm holding in the club
I gotta be the fucking star
So everybody wanna smile, and raise they hands
I got a razor, case I gotta
Do a necks (next) man
Cause you know how niggas be
They wanna see if Pac is real
Or is he like that nigga in the movie
I guess I gotta prove my point
Slicin' motherfuckers now I'm doing the joint
I got my nigga B-I to the G beside me
Bitches on my dick you know the hoes wanna ride me
And my other homies out here like Spike Lee
They got the camera on a nigga guess they like me
But now I'm bout to pass this motherfucker on
Cause this Tanqueray is getting hella strong

[Verse 2: Biggie Smalls]

Uh,Uh
Money, hoes and clothes blunt smoke coming out
The nose is all a nigga knows, flippin' on foes, puttin' tags on toes
Watchin' the stash grow, clockin the cash flow, the neighborhood grave digger
Gettin' paid so much all the bitches wanna see a nigga,I guessed they figured im
Paid i wanna get laid or since i got loot i wanna knock boots,huh, i rather beat
My dick then trick and if she dont suck then we dont fuck huh, I rather lick a buck drive a
Fatass truck grab the nine two clips and run them up,yes, flex out the 2 or 3 benz's since i
Wreck shit,what the fuck do you expect it, a fly guy, well fuck it imma' high guy from bed-stuy
Puttin' the swellin' on your eye and your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin'
And when police come, I'm leavin'[Intro:Biggie Smalls]
