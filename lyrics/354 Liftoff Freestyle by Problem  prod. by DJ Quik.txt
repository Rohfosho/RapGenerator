Nigga I'm from Compton, what up Quik? You my nigga bro
Doin' 80 in Figueora, condition is critical, I can't get caught slippin'
By my foes or the po's, boy I've been sippin'
Shoutout to my nigga Villain nana crippin' even on cell day
Big Nick, Ludolph, Bird Nose, and LJ
Dice games on a 102nd and Maine
Way before I hit the traffickin' game
Nowadays I'm just traffickin' game, you better get some
Get out the way 'fore I hit some, erhhh, pop
I love droppin' bitch niggas crazy
Eat a bowl of shit 'fore a bitch nigga play me
Ballin', bitch try to play me
Kobe, KDs are laced up, in the club Aced up
Tatted from the waist up, fuck like a straight slut
Nah-ah-ah-ah-ah, that's for real
And ho I don't need a pill
Independent gettin' skrilla, I don't need a deal
You pussies want a problem, get in that long line
Get that long line, yeah yeah, a long line
Run it wrong you'll be done in six seconds, no Vine
Tell your ho to come over, she'll be there in no time
Like she watchless, it's Showtime, ho watch this
If I call you for me to come over I'm coming to stick
Chopsticks, pull it out she lock lips
Yeah, let me hit it bare then I might get her some head
Diamond Lane the Gang, and I bang it like a snare
On god, bow down to no man
I'm a bar, no Rosanne, El Segando to Rosecrans, reppin'
Westside steppin'
Eastside mind state with three K's Andre
I'm an outcast, honey mmm in the house stash
We'll just take you out for the right cash
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no date
Birthday love cakes as much as Boog loves Satan
(You got served) In every way possible
Shit get hostile, I get colder than a hospital
So don't be bangin' under false pretense
Cause if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense boy!
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Yeah)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence (What?)
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (Cause I ain't playin' with your punk ass, boy)
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Diamond Lane, Money Gang, everything we run it)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (What up, Problem?)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (What?)
Now look who came up in this bitch
Mister look like shit, but I know he rich
Get at me, I thought you mothafuckas be happy
But they not cause they took a back seat like a taxi
I'm a latch key kid, Home Alone so often
But I had to come back to my Cali like Culkin
I was born out here, then I moved out there
Nigga check my core, man this shit ain't fair
I got a track with Alley Boy, Fredo, and Problem
So you know I'm in the hood just like I'm a culprit
Python, check the app, I'm hangin' with coders
Man that Bino goin' off, I thought that I told you
I used to date this fly girl with a place in the Dons
We used to cruise Leimert Park in a Beamer
Love a Cali girl so much, have you seen her?
Shout out to Latinas, look at all these hynas
Bino is the highest, niggas know I'm childish
I be on that Y shit, and she down to roll
Ate her pussy like a sachi teriyaki bowl
Hey yo Problem? (What up?) This a diss track right
Fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, you can't rap
You need help, you all industry hype
Most of these niggas aight
None of them holdin' a light to me
Wearin' some wifer tees, like it was '93
After the riots, niggas is violent
Sprayed the llama, took the L shit, wasn't silent though
Middle finger crossed up, niggas now you know
For real
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Damn Bino)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (Yeah)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Cause if it don't make dollars it don't make sense)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Compton California, that's where I'm from)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (Diamond!)
