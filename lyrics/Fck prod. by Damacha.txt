[Intro]
Now I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys..

[Verse 1: Chester Watson]
Gorge myself and do heroin just to slim up
Narrow vision periphery fucked initially misery
Struct and livin' invisibly
Fuck wit' me yellin' cheers
I'm drunk we still chuggin' beers
I'm fuckin' rich money dirty as sluts in huts at the Wierda[?]
A huntsmen covered in fear
Write covenants baby tell me she love this shit
Check the year of the rubbish rubbin' dear love[?]
Barely conscious so I'm sorry cuz' I prolly' do all the shit that you feared of
Like Hitler, Stallin, or Sey'tung
Idi Amin, I'm slayin' a vivid scholar wit' ranks
Peepin' dollars in the bank tech
Gotta' take a rain check
Was let a stray by the ways of the late shex[?]

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 2: Chester Watson]
Yugoslavic Slovenian
Who is toppin' iridium flows?
The best is sittin' in gold
Betta' yet gold drank
Metallic drips
Livin' a fallacy watch the roll play
Thoughts fairly close to the vast vacuums crowed space

Uhhhhh

A mad violent contestant
Reincarnation phasing watch this (aye tu er ala puerta)[?]
Flagrant is raining visually
Crazy favored the sceptre of Hades but I'm to busy famous gettin' my bread up
Fucking movement if you ain't' cool with me dead luck
Non-rappin' bastards is back to school
And the masters know
Pacifist is hela' smooth but co pacifist cause I'm fed up
Vape the lead stuffed in his head
This dudes a mess but
Check does he have breath?
Yup
Fuck
Now its lookin' like the ramen off Jess
The atomic bomb sets in
[screams]
I'm derilent[?] feelin' wrecked a band did it or contest me
Grab her by her left cheek
Slap it
She gives me the vibe that she'd be the best freak
Ha
But wait
Back to the methods of death juice
Me and Damacha cosment copper copin' the best trees
Sip the best T
Come correct G
