Now I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys..



Gorge myself and do heroin just to slim up

Narrow vision periphery fucked initially misery

Struct and livin' invisibly

Fuck wit' me yellin' cheers

I'm drunk we still chuggin' beers

A huntsmen covered in fear

Write covenants baby tell me she love this shit

Barely conscious so I'm sorry cuz' I prolly' do all the shit that you feared of

Like Hitler, Stallin, or Sey'tung

Idi Amin, I'm slayin' a vivid scholar wit' ranks

Peepin' dollars in the bank tech

Gotta' take a rain check





Yugoslavic Slovenian

Who is toppin' iridium flows?

The best is sittin' in gold

Betta' yet gold drank

Metallic drips

Livin' a fallacy watch the roll play

Thoughts fairly close to the vast vacuums crowed space



Uhhhhh



A mad violent contestant

Flagrant is raining visually

Crazy favored the sceptre of Hades but I'm to busy famous gettin' my bread up

Fucking movement if you ain't' cool with me dead luck

Non-rappin' bastards is back to school

And the masters know

Pacifist is hela' smooth but co pacifist cause I'm fed up

Vape the lead stuffed in his head

This dudes a mess but

Check does he have breath?

Yup

Fuck

Now its lookin' like the ramen off Jess

The atomic bomb sets in

Grab her by her left cheek

Slap it

She gives me the vibe that she'd be the best freak

Ha

But wait

Back to the methods of death juice

Me and Damacha cosment copper copin' the best trees

Sip the best T

Come correct G
