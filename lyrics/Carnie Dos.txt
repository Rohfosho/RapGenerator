Hey Sarah-

I know we haven't talked in some weeks

But, you are basically the base of anything that I can think of

Whenever I think of dope, I--



Wait a second...

I don't even fuck with Sarah no more





I'm writing with my mind cause my fingers are now arthritic, I'm leaving alone the pen, my position ain't criticism

Watch this magic trick, just know that getting lifted is my magician

I ripped it and then I stitched it

You snitching, and now I'm dipping

These gremlins is in my kitchen

They giving out too much Ritalin

In need of my attention, but I'm chiefing like I'm an Indian

Greatness is in the making

Guru in Nu Age the genesis

We must be alchemists because we are creating the synthesis

Rolling with different gems and it's stolen, but who could give a shit?

Mowing through the garden, then I'm trolling with Colored Ninjas

Bitch

Rolling round with my nigger friends, bowling down by the ginger kids

And try and fuck with me? I ain't your friend, I'm your nemesis

No we aren't a gang nor' do we dance or walk this cryptic shit

I don't care about the fame, I just want a little grip to spend

My steeze is too slick, have you tripping like you slipped in it

My nickname should be Rick, 90 spiff, I say I'm hipster bitch



Yo

Chester Watson, killing it, here we go, Carnies





You can buy love, but you can't buy talent

We're fouler than old cow meat in a rusty chalice

I'm cranking up the power to devour all you sour chicks

This tower has an hour before it showers on her big flower tits

The beat's howling, has your ears cowarding out on the wave shit

It's like nitro going psycho

Nu Age is stealing whips and then we're testing them

With a little hydrolic synthesis

News is getting gruesomer

Ask all the sinners

Well, Chester reps Lucifer

The Nu Age is as winners and

Spitting like a crab has a hold of my tongue

I'm shitting like I sat a bag of laxative in my stomach

No weapons, but I guess that we are all gunning

My pits be kinda musty, those chicks be kinda busty

I can't be a wolf so I'm a Siberian Husky

Are you guys lucky or was that rusty nail not supposed to truck me?
