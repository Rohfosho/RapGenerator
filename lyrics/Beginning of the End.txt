Welcome

It’s a little bit weird to be saying hi now

I don’t know

Let’s just say we’re fashionably late

Fashionably behind the times

I don’t know

Call it what you will

I guess what we’re trying to say is

We’re glad to be here

Thank you for having us

And maybe we’ll see you when it’s over



A dead philosopher said history is written by survivors

Isn’t that the band that wrote the song “Eye of the Tiger”?

Nevermind man, fuck the writer, fuck the title, fuck the image

The only shit that counts is who’s alive when this is finished

Never going to make it to the end

I don’t want to wake up in a bed that ain’t my own

Away from home, I’m slipping up and then I’m thinking I’m dead, check my pulse

Get the nurse! Fear the worst!

I’m gonna rest my eyes

I’m going the moment I knowing I’m over the fork in the road, I’m taking the hearse

Nobody breaks the curse, nobody follows the thief, we only chase the purse

All of us came from dirt, so when you meet your maker face the earth

No I don’t talk fast because I’m a frightened hypochondriac

It’s not some crazy fucking schizo Michel Gondry act

Yo it’s Michelle, go to hell, I’m about to lose it

George don’t be stupid

I have an alibi I’m standing by and I'mma use it

Forget it, fuck the edits

This shit was over way before it started

Roll the credits
