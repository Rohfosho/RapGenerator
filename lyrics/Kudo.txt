All gold revolver, for the suicide
Gold bullets, two gold brains, when I shoot to die
I'm askin' chicky-D's, can I supersize, my happy meal?
Then I'm dippin' out with dolla', and we yellin' Guten Tag.
People trying to crucify us
Steady spittin' lucid fire, im ludicrous
I know a bitch I wanna take home, like a new messiah
People used to mock, my goofy attire
Now everybody, tryin' to get like Chester
Sayin' "ooh, tight as fuck"
And he high too, tryin'a stay lifted, like his high IQ
Strollin' down the island, of the dutty, blurtin' "I do!"
Hair hella long, like I use newgrowth
Never poppin' guns, but I'm steady, shootin' kudos
Same one, never catch me cakin', with a new ho
Unless we on break, then I'm bankin' up, a new roll
King sized paper, shootin' lasers, to the new folk
Ring side places, for the lakers, that's a new hope
Nigga
