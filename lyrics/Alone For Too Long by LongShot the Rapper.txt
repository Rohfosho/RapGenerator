I've been alone so long I forgot the way I'm meant to feel
I've been alone so long, it's the only thing that’s even real
I've been alone so long, it's the only thing I know
I've been alone so long, I've become my biggest foe
I see happy relationships, like I want that
I see awful relationships, like I still want that
I see attractive women that want nothing to do with me
I see myself in the mirror, I want nothing to do with me
So sick of this cocktail of feelings in my mind
So sick of chasing love, and going in blind
So sick of being rejected and hurt
So sick of being pushed down into the dirt
Just truth, no witty lines
Just truth, just what’s on my mind
Just truth, and I feel so far
Just truth, I’m so sick of these scars
I’m almost eighteen years old and I’ve never been kissed
I’m almost eighteen years old and I’ afraid that I won’t be missed
I’m still seventeen and I still can’t tell
If when I’m seventy, there will be a girl under my spell
Now I’m not even looking for the one
Now I'm just looking for a test run
Now I'm just looking for someone to show me that love is real
Now I just someone to show me how it feel
We can make it easy
We can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there
Promise to be gentle
Sittin' by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
We can make it easy
We can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there
Promise to be gentle
Sittin' by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
We can make it easy
We can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there
Promise to be gentle
Sittin' by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
