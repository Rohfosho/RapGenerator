Keeping it G ain't nuttin, you ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it

You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it

Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

I got the whole block bumpin

You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it

You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it

Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public



Na na na na now now you know what this is

Tell em its a celebration bitches

With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes

Mini-skirts, Hennessys, and the Miller Lites

Domino tables, who got big 6?

Where I'm from we do concrete backflips

Flip flop flip flop flip flop back

To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back

Real niggas love me, they tell me keep it pushin

The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings

County jails and the lock downs up north

Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch

Thats how they feel Jack, built much more than rap

This that project haircut in the culdesac

This is where Jose front you them quarters at

Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track

Nigga





From Compton to Baltimore I'mma kill it

I buy a morgue in the minute

The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant

The Regal window is tinted

The air conditioner broke but I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo, huh?

And I peel off in the midst of getting my thrills off

And I thrive off energies from the inner cities that we lost, huh?

I'm putting the ghetto on top of my back

And I live in the back of the jungle

Lions, tigers, bears, oh my

Hear the siren, walk up, (*pow pow*) drive by

Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders

The engines on back of scooters

The real can recognize real and we need to know just who you are

You are in the presence of many presents

Kendrick the gift for the future oh yeah I said it

Thug life, good kid mad city mad respect representin the hub right





The home girls tells me I'm the shit

I break them off so they can buy some outfits

I buy them sons a pack of pampers, some new jordans

Give em the game, school em on whats really important

It's how I was raised, the og's had me

13 fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi

But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas

There's other ways you get them dollars and funds niggas

Coming down in an old school, so cool

Whip like a fire ball call it Goku

You don't know the tribulations that we go through

Put your ears to the speakers I'mma show you

I paint the picture so perfect

In my cd you see Mona Lisa in person

Courtesy of a hunnit beat

Got my crips and esse's at arm reach, one West
