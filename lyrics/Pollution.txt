Yo
Native American, mixed with that Swahili flow
Higher than fucking helium dying cause my cerebrum froze
Hungry like hobos addicted to having pizza
And I roll up often so I stay chiefing on Queen Latifah toes
We be the same age, but we ain't equal though
These niggas mad cause Carnie was dope
But when the sequel close, they gonna be mad as fuck
Watch 'em pack my bags and junk
Fucking up beats like I was hired to go and stab 'em plus I
Roundhouse, drop kick, right hook, jab 'em up
Karate chop with Jackie's knucks, highest like I got Alvin's nuts
Stay golden with magnums but, whenever there's action
Rip the Trojan out the package so that we can get it cracking uhm
It's fucking magic how I'm filled with all this passion
And talent, I stay losing my heart but in the wonderland like Alice
I got to go back to Loki, count me stuck in rusty chalices, hypnotize the audience
Watch how my medallion swings I'll have the crowd singing wowzers
Pull the nug out of my camper green like this yellow bowser
My eyes saw some weird shit, I'm Oedipus, I gouged 'em out
Money is so evil so I shred it up like sauerkraut
Nu Age is what I'm about, make a chant, shout it out
Change of plans, I'm passing out, dangerous but not a grouch
In an asylum with this girl named Mimi
They put me in a jacket, I escape it, I'm Houdini
Put pollution in paninis, I'm zooted with the team-y
That's Comme, Dolla Mike, Duke Costello and K Breezy
Da Vinci, AB Biggles, Mike J we be puffin' tree-zies
It's easy we spit it, remember when I used to be playing
Feces equipment, remember my first time, it ain't easy as pimpin'
That's cheese it's all over the bee-zy, cause children was eatin' and watchin' TV
We livin' we lavish just do it with steez
That's a given I'm beast to you pissin' on Easy Street
Failed All my classes at least three weeks straight
I never told mom cause she didn't need it on her plate
So I told her everything was good and everything turned out great, yeah
