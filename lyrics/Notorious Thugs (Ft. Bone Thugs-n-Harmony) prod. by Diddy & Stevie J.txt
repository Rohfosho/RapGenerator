[Intro: Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie [repeat 8X]

[Notorious BIG]
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed - no angel dust, label us "Notorious"
Thug ass niggas that love to bust; it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through!
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your Gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga: die slowly
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me:
"Cash Rules Everything Around Me"
Shit...lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself loving it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer, me or you?

(We forgive you, for you know not what you do)

[Bizzy]
7 A.M., woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean
Nigga Dean, deep in my temple and not to get
Sentimental, I sting with my
Instrumelody, and heated
Especially for your team
And a .45, indeed, will beam
In between the scenes. Destroy your dreams
You willing to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs
Trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spitting fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breaking out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now. Contender - never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, and my hen
One of my trusted friend-friends, hey
Open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marching, we shooting!
In daily recruiting there's a thug born
Everyday in the ghetto
We start em off little, we give em a bottle
And a pen and a pad to hit the label, kick it

[Krayzie]
Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feeling that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12-gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga your loss, take it all off
Got a nigga caught off
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinking they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch: if you steppin' we buckin' them guts, that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smoking the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be serving em dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talking
Like "gimme back me money"
Thugging with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiending for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money, so
I'm making my dummy rocks if I go broke

[Hook]
Just Bone and Biggie Biggie, we gonna rock the party
Rock the party, party
Just Bone and Biggie Biggie, better run and tell everybody
Everybody, everybody

Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Get high, get high, get high

[Layzie]
Yeah, Little Lay, hey, coming in the form of scripture
Finna get you and hit you with magic
Droppin down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic-status, we spray, time to load the Glocks
But I'm thinking not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always running from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue’s on my ass, pull out the cellular phone to call Bone
"What's happenin'?"
Grab artillery, a nigga start packing
Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin, and I did him
Hit him right between the eyes, the spot was wise
Wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'mma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with #1?
Bloody red red - rum rum rum rum rum rum
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
That red red rum
