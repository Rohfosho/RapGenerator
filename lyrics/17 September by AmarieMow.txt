[Verse 1: AmarieMowatt]

I was walking on the pavement either 3 or 5
When I got a message from Compton saying I’ve been compromised
I was scared sitting on the train
It was only a terminal away
Finally got my ticket sitting in the cargo bay with my assistant
4 seconds later he got a premonition
Didn’t want to talk to me
Anyway didn’t know what he was saying
Started talking to him
Didn’t say anything back to he
Then he told me as his glory
I wondering if it stayed in his memory

[Hook: AmarieMowatt]
Why you sitting in the departure
When the desk already call yah
What you need to do is run to the plane before the door closes on yah
Just get a bull full of pepper and he’ll glide to it
Bull full of pepper and he’ll glide to it
You think that your late
But im telling you your not
If you don’t stand up you might get caught
Just get a bull full of pepper and he’ll glide to it
Bull full of pepper we’re gonna glide to it

[Verse 2: A.J Angel]
Quickly go there before the captain takes off
I’ll try and hold him but I know that won’t be enough
Son I know you want to go to the states de facto and all
But I think it’s time you turn around and go back home
Don’t worry I’ll tell that you came up with a plan you went back home
Telling your mum all the news and what went wrong
I know she’ll be expecting money
But sorry honey you’ll just have to say you gave it to bugsy
MAAA!!!!

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
