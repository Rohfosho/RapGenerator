It's like intellectuals went extinct

My consciousness saying that it's perpetual at the brink of the abyss

I sit at the exit and then dismiss



I'm only in this for revenue and the kicks

So you can catch me chilling with decimals in my clique

Throwing spliffs to the head and exhaling into a crypt

Where I'm from, niggas ruthless, they carry nooses and clips



I'm the puppet

Master

Controlling all these people with my fucking

Accent



Smoke much dope

Busters

Can't say I ain't fucking classic



Clutching and worship



Governor

Behead niggas

In all black

Reminiscing of cartel and fed niggas



Hard to tell

But he said wicked bread driven

Not hard to smell

Because the threads in it



The villain

Mega-mellow like he careless but he's hell-bending

And he the Wooki, never hairless but imperil sitting

So where your niggas because my niggas don't see narrow limits

With no campus steady painting pictures like we arrow knitting



Puppet

Masters

Controlling all these people with our fucking

Tactics



Smoke much dope

Busters

Can't say we ain't fucking classic



Clutching and worship
