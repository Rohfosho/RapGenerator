Stockholm city we're burned out

Yoshi city we burn it down

I guess it's my turn now

Smoking loud I'm a lonely cloud

I'm a lonely cloud, with my windows down

I'm a lonely, lonely, I'm a lonely, lonely



Might be the only hope I got left

Blessed without success

Fuck stress I'm gonna trust the best

I'm nervous that she's so upset

She don't want me, bitch I'm flustered

I'm an aristocrat without the progress

Roses all on her wedding dress, blood from her mouth, I'm a mess

Alien faces everywhere I go

Downtown bitch that's where I smoke

Got my heart next to my phone

Do or die? Stupid high

Lonely nights, finna sacrifice

Fuck your life I need mine

I'll take yours and rewind

Walk in my shoes you'll see why

Fuck everyone, I donâ€™t reply

Sad boys bitch we world wide

Grey sweatshirt, L size

Wakizashi and grape Nikes

Fuck norms, fuck a normal life

Fuck norms I'll break em out

Yerno Blood, that's what I said

Lean, lean, lean you got it in your head

Like a disease you know I spread

I can't sleep with out you on my bed

Yoshi city, that's the town

All me, I came up now

Sad boys, time to burn it down

Windows down, face out

Squad up when we riding out

We riding out
