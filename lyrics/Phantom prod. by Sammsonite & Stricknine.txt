Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Yo, being hella brash is the swag bruh
Sittin' back and im gettin' ass in Nebraska
Different flask in a different class rolling grass up
Nu Age only spitting facts no whack stuff
Yeah, that’s how we do it no taxin’
My niggas comin' through and we slashin' with axes
Bag a fine chick, back tats and an accent
Niggas tryna 'lab I'mma ask where the racks is
Uh, cause we don’t do this for free
Im zoot and I'm starved and a dude gotta eat
No clockin' out, workin' all day; no sleep
Bring the block out, twerkin' all day, that shit hot
That’s why we never asks where the streets went
Dude slangin' trees more cheese for the defense
K-F-C, two piece, hella greasy
Little slop, but you see a dude still eatin’
A dude still chiefin’ cause the rules don’t matter
Don’t need any beef cause 'em tools go splatter, rata, tata
Shootin' bullshit it'll come back whizzin' your drawers get splattered
Where I'm from any niggas wearin' jewels gettin' snatched up
All about the C.R.E.A.M every fool got back up
Can't hear Jesus cause the weed is loud as Mack trucks
Phantom all black and the volume to the max
Doin' drive by's so they don’t know where we at
All you hear is tires, click-clack, booms of the gats
No cure for the madness, so it's like cancer
Bumpin' “It’s a hobo” just became the death anthem
The whip fouettin' like a dancer
Is she paying blant up and get slanted
Disrespect the fam' I'mma have to back hand ya
And niggas be hatin' they hella mad cause I'm handsome
Gold Phantom, rancids aren’t random
Kidnap the game and hold it with no ransom
A ghostly flow, we hang clothes with no hanger
Music without me is like dark with no Manson
Nigga just snuff 'em, and leave they nose flarin'
Slow motion, that’s a board with bad bearings
People in awe, my God, just keep 'em starrin'
I like my fishes Pacific so I copped a red herrin'
From the bottom, light totes with no handles
African Sheppard im leadin' goats with no sandals
Niggas stay sellin' they soul for most stamina
Don’t invite yourself
Im the host with no manners, bitch
