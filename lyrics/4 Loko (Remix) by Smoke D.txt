Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine
It's that ASAP
Gimme that beat, No take backs
Flow so hard I say facts
These real slugs, y'all 8-track
That's fool's gold
I’m two, four
Yellow and purp, I move slow
Stacking all my cool dough
Teacher need that too, though
I'm just copping sneakers
And a couple heaters
Load it up on ammo
Dumping all these features
Fucking with me? Nah, my man
It’s clear to see you high my man
Ain't no system, try my man
Then they wonder why, my man
Moving like we moving
Rising like we rising

Take the dick out the pussy, put it in the throat
Jiggas can’t say no to James

Spillin' purple on the Moncler
Splitting swishers, blunts up in the air

Cause when I'm on the east, I fuck with rough
On the west, my drink is rum
Fuck my dog
Fuck my peso
Suck my dick ho

Never made love but I fuck a lot
Taking shots of that tiger balm
Jeremy Scott Tiger on
Fixing a blunt at the blunt fitting dope

Stupid bread, retarded money

Counting money, y’all flick the conch

My cups double
My blunts rolled
And I'm shaking these haters like Hakeem the Dream
