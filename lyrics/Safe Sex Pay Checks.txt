Full lyrics coming on January 6th, 2015
...Volume

Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody
Got enough for everybody, we crankin' up the volume
Turn the music up louder, get loose and move your body
Get loose and move your body, we crankin' up the volume

Safe sex, and paychecks
That's what it's all about, don't forget about
Safe sex, and paychecks...
