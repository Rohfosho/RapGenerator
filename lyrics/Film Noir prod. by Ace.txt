[Verse 1]
Just been chilling in the wilderness
Had the fighter drone bring foam for the swivel whip
Pivot chips, Skylark's wig any simpleton
So I guess I'm feeling real nice since I did some pills
Sike, spit, ice it'll give you chills, nigga
Always wondered what I'd look like with a bigger grill
Might steam rice for a different seal heist
Beam lights, let the embers build, finished, killed sights
On the winter flips, wife's pretty limber
Nick dust keeps knights at night yelling timber
My eyes getting tender from the smoke, duct seeping from the white
Silver vent get less civil rights but he’s sick, ummmm
Music kept me sane for awhile
Now my flip name got a little fame and my style
Gets an upgrade, mad bummy but he’ll show you right
Wander in the forest getting stoned with the poltergeist

[Hook]
It seems like life’s in film noir
I get that everyday [x2]

[Verse 2]
For the creams that are burning under lit cigs
With the super villain's verge of earning plunder quick swigs
Chilling at the spot near the dock by the ditch bridge
Clocks get ripped as the shot gets swifter
But blast back like scratching the winds blow
Sick fit six high hats hacking his Thor
Light pack of chits with a kite or in tenfold
Eye bags cringe nose tight from the stench
I’m at the freighter still skating
But now I’m in the crater with high and box raven
Sitting higher than the ancients, blood, sap, paint
Switch gears, smoke blunts, get lunch reacquaint with
My thoughts don’t floss if it ain’t spiff
Chilling at the bank, get lost in the faint shift
Shit, my height the narrow cliff
So stoned we converse with the psychedelic schizo

[Hook x2]
