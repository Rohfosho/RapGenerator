(Fuck you and everything you fucking represent, you piece of shit, I mean it)
Swimming Fallopians of Ethiopian women
The wheels is spinning, moon is glistening
View exquisite, not viewing witness
A youth that's twisted
Off purple liquid made to cure the sickness
Feel like my vision took a (Pitch shift)
Smoking that Samson got me lifted
I'm the one who gave your girl cousin them drugs
Your little brothers plug
I'll hawk spit inside your mothers mug
Take a finest bottle, pour the liquor out for all my ones above
The last shot is for the homies locked
Lit the crop, hit the lot
Double spinning til the Guinness drop
Pull off in forth gear
Put it in park, the whores they seen me say the law's here
My voice is horse from them ports, yeah
Over here, we don't support fear
Road to the riches, and the coast clear
I'm riding til' the tire sparking and exhaust tear
It's on, Yeah
Activist and cactus cooler
I bit the apple on the Mac computer, you a loser
There ain't a subject I can't tackle, either now or sooner
Ain't got no shoulder pads, but collateral past to a
Running back, running rap, I bet you wish he knew ya
Black lip pastor... Hallelujah
Soulo in this ho, that mean this church up in this bitch
Gave her a sermon then I hit, God...
I'm an entity into titties, a fat ass, some clean pussy
And some good weed
Knowledge and wisdom in abundance, infinite energy
And I'll be sure to write night and day... literally
Deadlines snapback, backwoods in my backpack
Zan with that lean nigga, shit you never seen nigga
Put that on my team nigga, 3 eyes, you see me bruh
Careful, you know the game's Te-D-i-ous
I hears they out there praying for the death of me
I been down and out, it's my destiny
I been 'round the block, it's no testin' me
We been ranting off, it's no extra keys
So what you got on lock my nigga?
I tried tell 'em, they ain't gon' get it
I've been prolific, been on this shit
You can check Mo Milli, that was like '08
You niggas ain't no factors
Just come around cause we ain't no actors
It's no scenes cut, just checks
Don't want 25, but I'll take my time
If a nigga come around tryna' to take what's mine
Tryna' take my life, good luck with that
We got guns for that, you're not coming back
I got fade in the bushes, lurking and looking
'bout that life, don't get yours took quick
Just a story of some kids left stranded
Couple of the homies and a couple automatics
Come to the hood, get a good pack out
Tombstone read "R.I.P." with your hood wacked out
You know what he about at Ramona Park 'til after dark
They drained their pool, we swam with sharks
We shooting fools of 7th street
You make the bed in which you sleep
I stay awake like visiting dead
With the hammer sitting in discrete in da' skreets
Sold drugs in your granny building
In front' the children
A piece of shit, i'll be considered the most
Baby hand on the dinner plate
I start the meal with a toast
Three assorted cheeses, they garnish the both
Cut the slices even
Distribute them to my assemblage of these fucking heathens
A bunch of demons in these polo fleeces
I clutch the reapers into bay polices
I burn the Priest and vanish in the breezes
I talk to Jesus, reconsidered features
Rain dance on black sanded beaches
Pick from the tree that bare the fruit of peaches
Slaying these skeezers and it feel the Eden
These backwards got me with the heavy breathing
Connecting Venus and the shit the cheapest
I hit the party with the Sherm perm
Ear rings look like strobe lights
I cop the gold fish platforms for the cold price
Hop out the V in all sequence, fish is Swedish
Sway Padorian, my shit the meanest, you need it
And i'm the founder of this shit
On the forty-sixth floor eating flounder with the shrimp
Got a awfully thick splore and I just pound her with the dick
Get the dope from outta broad, destroy the county with the shit
Piece of shit records, where dreams come true
You saying fuck me? I'm saying fuck you
(And fuck your moms and them, go fuck your aunts daughter
You piece of shit, you're disgusting, I fucking hate you.)
