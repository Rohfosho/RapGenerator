No flex zone, no flex zone

They know better, they know better

No flex zone, no flex zone

They know better, they know better

Won a gold medal

And a gold bezel

I treat it so special

Now your ho jealous

Freak Hoes got several

They tens or better

I’m a trendsetter

I’m a go-getter



Paper chasing

I'm game changing

Big money big banking

And you must be mistaken

Call me Young Social

So clear like bifocals

Niggas wanna hate on my vocals

My career 'bout to be an explosion

You know I'm so cool

Got fine girls swim in my pool

Weak boys saying I'm cruel

They must not know that I rule

My crew blow up like a supernova

Got dead pres. and silver tokens

Everywhere I go I'm gonna cause a

Commotion

Still so young don't got no diploma

Hipster Gang we ride or die

My Veyron got suicides

I'm so flawless don't need to try

Homies can't get swag but they

Loving mine

I'm the trillest no challenge

No time to micromanage

Haters wanna talk until I gotta cap 'em

So I just killed the haters god bless 'em

Psych I am not done yet

Y'all ain't hype bruh y'all ain't fun yet

Y'all crusty like some Funyuns

My girl chest like two munchkins

No gorilla I'm King Kong

Asian girls on my Ching Chong

Pull up to that Bando

Turn my Motorola ring on

Guap in the crib and loud in my ride

Drink that lean bruh have some pride

Now she twerking I don't mind

I guess I'm just too goddamn kind

It's a no flex zone

So if you flex go home

Or my whole crew mirk you

Like you Caesar of Rome nigga



My verse pass through the hook

When I pull up you gotta look

I'm looking fresh the whole place shook

Write this down in my bio book

Bitch I'm the greatest it's Mike WiLL Made It on the beat

Don't try to front when you see me

In the street

Crew crew my team got the others

At defeat

Something like a hip-hop elite

No love for you hoes kiss my ass

I have to get back to class

Got A$AP Rocky, Ferg, and Nast

Then Fuckin' Problems come last

Obviously with my Triple Beam

Midnight Run like Royce and Skeme

But I keep my girls in the back

Because I'm just so fucking mean

Faded as hell man get on my level

My gold medal my gold bezel

Hoes got several tens or better

Trendsetter hipster go-getter

This young bastard be geekin

Y'all can't match my physique

This time no interception

Just killed the haters god bless 'em

Thank You Based God
