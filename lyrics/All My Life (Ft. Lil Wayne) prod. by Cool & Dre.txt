I was on the block right, wasn't in my right mind

Just a young nigga, hustling, trying to get mines

Movin' with the 9 double M

Niggas like you don't really wanna fuck with him

Yeah, young teenager, infatuated with paper

Yeah I had to get it cause momma, she wasn't able

Black and white TV set, no cable

40's in the fridge, chicken noodles on the table

I wasn't born with a silver spoon

Child of the ghetto, raised off a different tune

Watching Bob Barker in my living room

If the price was right, I could get you a whole living room

Yeah, them was my gutter ways back in the gutter days

No education but the gutter pays, through it all, I came a long way

From selling the yay, fist fights to gun play, back then



Sittin' on the block and I'm doing bad

Dreaming about the things that I never had

Got me thinking to myself I gotta get it man

You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man

I say, all my life I've known one day eventually, I'll blow



Yeah, times is hard as it is

That's why I got guns and my guns got kids

That's why I be going so tough on them hoes

I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold

Fuck with a nigga, let go fuck with some hoes

Hear them bitches screaming like they stuck in a hole

I am not a demon but was once a lost soul

Till I found myself a block away from the cross road

I have outgrown the fishbowl

And I'm on my feet like a fuckin insole

Yeah it may hurt like a fucking lymph node

But it's fuck the world like a fucking nympho

And we spend dough cause we make more and I make sure when I say so

It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more?

Clothesline the beat, Ted DiBiase flow, yeah





Jay Rock, still that same O.G

I ain't trying see the grave or the penitentary

Everyday living, trying to stay on my feet

Even though a nigga paid but my heart in the streets

See my dogs, I'm a beast, so hard on these beats

So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see no income

Here come Jay Rock, they know crack music, drug kingpin flow, oh



Kingpin ho, need I say more?

Your family could die, when I say go-go

Green light, green light, what ya green like?

Before ya sign me up, get the scene right

And I just hop in the phantom when I'm feelin nice

Cause driving slow in the Lam', it doesn't seem right

Yeah and I remember them long nights

Living the wrong life but I made that wrong right, Weezy



All the struggling, all it does is keep my hustling, oh my
