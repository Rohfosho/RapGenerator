[Verse 1]
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, is reflecting my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, roll model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the riches still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, cause these niggas is fake
They ain't popping shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
If I ain't meant to shine, beat me up in a rhyme spot
No crying 'til I'm in pine box
I got the bitches hitting Mikey like where Zay at?
Probably fucking on her friend, probably L.A. at
Probably plotting on a mil staying where Fay at
Bitch don't run your mouth we don't play that
Mama taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather, go figure nigga
They ain't worried about this cheddar
Them niggas just sky diving in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't trying to be no freshman, I'm chilling
Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and not kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willing
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like talking my shit
Come in the house, acting friendly, you can suck my dick

[Bridge]
I'm praying for some good rappers and a fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga speak up
Rocking old flows corn rows and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes and I ain't even tripping
Cause we'll be laughing to the bank and riding by these niggas
Mikey bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fucking trunk and bring the party with me

[Hook]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
Your brain no have no conscious, what you do now?
I came, I saw, I conquered, I shot you down
I bang, I bang, I blocka, what you do now?
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, what you do now?

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Everything takes time
Is you selling or you buying nigga? Get rich or die trying
Yay yay on the stove, I had the choppers in the Cutlass
Just a young nigga tryna get some hundreds
I had a little bucket, yeah, I rode it like a benz
Yeah I spent my little ends on that Butlass
Tell me who you trust
Look I got my faith in God cause these clown ass niggas all bustas
These niggas not Jesus, they ain't gonna die for you
And only time will tell what's gon' lie for you
It's funny right what a couple lies will do
But seeing is believing what defines the truth
I keep shooters on the wing when I'm riding through
And if niggas out of bounds they gon probably shoot
Cause killing is the hobby
Eastside niggas, yeah, we known for catching bodies
I used to have a deuce five riding on the trolly
On my way to school like dare nigga try me
Look, cause where I'm from I'm a blood on an island
Surrounded by blue water, sharks all around me
Pigs on my ass, hoes tryna drown me
Niggas know I'm up so these haters wanna down me
Niggas know I'm king but they don't wanna crown me
It's okay, I ain't 'bout to whine about it
Look, a real nigga for real nigga, now check it
I'm still here I'm still counting my blessings
With no chains on, with no rings on
Watching these fake rappers, getting my aim on
Pop a shot, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
And watch 'em fall like confetti, fuck 'em all (fuck 'em all)
It's just me and my niggas taking over the game
And since I conquered this craft, nothing will be the same

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Not a dollar on me, this home invasion a payday
Two time felon they jerking me on my pay rate
Slaving all these hours but couldn't shake that my rent late
Making eight an hour I'm leaning towards my AK
Moms thinks I'm vicious, don't want me round the kitchen
My living room, bathroom, my bedroom was evicted
Missing from your homeroom my good grades was cripping
Before I even learned division, nigga I learnt the mission
See I'm from where fiends scratch that itch, won't hit the lotto
And I'm from where fiends fix that fix and not a  bottle
And that little nigga that missed that bottle gon' catch a hollow
Or maybe even throw him pyro, pyro
See this set don't make too many niggas rich that I know
You either gang bang, sell dope or bet on the four
See money on the ground, my eyes glued to the floor
I double deuce by my toe, see Figg get it and go
I feel stuck in my ways, a nigga just tryna get paid
I'm tired of answering questions why Oxymoron delayed
See I was thinking November, but January is sweet
It set my setbacks free, my habits won in my sleep
So January agree, get a taste of this gangsta
See I'm just tryna eat, with a freak of the week
I'm just tryna hit 'em and leave 'em, dog, they yours for the keep
But don't be kissing them broads, my sperm on their teeth
Last night was nothing, this morning I'm a hero
No belief in me, dawg, they said I'd mount to zero
Cocaine, cocaine, rock, rock kilo
Fishscale, cut well, you won't find Nemo
Pull up to the block and they call me real nigga
See I can be a real nigga, but my daughter see me bigger
See a body full of love and yours full of liquor
But you'll always be my nigga, said you'll always be my nigga

[Hook]
