Hydrophilic villain nice flow type, spindle sit

Spin into the thin abyss, disappear, middle lit

Pro-life's crindle leaves are frivol print

Look at the bigger picture, people focus on the little shit

I'm hoping that the bitter end is bittersweet, Switzerland, the Middle East

-ern instruments are brittle, please don't touch 'em, give me riddle peace

Rushing through this little league phase, born a Christian

Wisdom fades as the distance grows, praise to a different ghost

Hazing, got a little taste, play a different role

Jaded, apathetic flavor, the nigga so

Great, a living maze, an enigma, get faded

Watching Anne Frank reading Hitler's notes

Pause time, rip space as the ninja goat

Grazes, ancient fragrance medicinal

Missing prose, I got pages of scribbles wrote

Ages ago, dead brains in the moat, nigga
