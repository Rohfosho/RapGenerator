Throw your hands in the sky right now

(Alors on danse)

Throw your hands in the sky right now

It's going down



Unfortunately for the rest of ya’ll

I’m way better than the best of all

And even though they focus on just the flaws

They still gonna annihilate the festivals

And we still gonna sip Dom Perignon

And still gonna eat the filet mignon

Yeah, yeah, yeah I’ve been known to cover up my eyes

With the Ray Beons



Alors on danse (x3)

Alors on, throw your hands in the sky right now

Alors on



Flashing lights, the stress of life

Its way too much to handle in one night

Live this life like there’s no tomorrow

Wake up in Paris with a Russian model

Throw your hands in the sky

If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now

I call this club Titanic

Why, cause it’s going down



Alors on danse (x4)

Alors on chante

Lalalalalala, lalalalalala

Alors on chante

Lalalalalala, lalalalalala

Alors on chante

Throw your hands in the sky right now

Alors on chante

Throw your hands in the sky right now

Et puis seulement quand c'est fini

Alors on danse (x5)



Roll call in the club

Life’s a bitch feel her up

She be in my mind like a microchip

I’m ready to blow like nitroglis

Gone gone like a light so trick

I am on some psycho shit

Dance floor every night my bliss

Fed up with the rub don't bite your lip

Bon T.R.S. and pure gold

Max this out in euros

Bartender fill it up till I can’t remember

Feeling hot summer nights in the winterr

I’mma better my life till we all sit up

Since we are here we are live

Ye and I make you touch the sky
