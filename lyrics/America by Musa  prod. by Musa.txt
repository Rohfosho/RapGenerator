Steal lives with a steel scythe in a black robe
Stab folks make em’ see the white light flash woah
Cash – Hoes – Smack – Dope – disrespect the flagpole
Disconnect your intellect your innocence get snatched oh
This is America
This is America
Fucking America
Better be ware of the
Better be ware of the
Drones in the sky – drones on the sidewalk
I talk nothing cause the eye watch -I watch
People get they eyes lost – people think that I’ve lost
My sanity can it be – lifted from the cannabi that I’m God
This is America
This is America
Fucking America
Better be ware of the
Better be ware of the
This is America
Exhaling Cannabis - my asthma ain't flarin up
New Package of tees, black dickies, and a pair of HUFs
Corrupt Youth Camper so not embarrassed my merits stuck
And blarin dust - Still in America
Ginger throwing her cake -
Beat it and leave and leave her with carrot stubs -
Turtle Beaches, we feature Jesus
And feed it bears with some cheesy pizza
And rich cheerleaders indeed are just steezy skeezers
But Nu Age rushed back
To the center of attention
Clan of beavers; muskrat (Shh)
And yea we keep it poppin like a puss bag
Gluten on his mustache
9th grade - no whip
Always copped a bus pass
In Georgia watching shit on Netflix
With an oversized, off brand bag of chex mix
Got a little fame still the same never exit
And switching views watching new dames grab their left tit
Cause..
This is America
This is America
Fucking America
Better be ware of the
Better be ware of the
Hypocrites – thought police – gotta stay vigilant
Pot please – gotta keep hittin it
Just to keep myself from not quitting this
(Gun Shot)
Just to keep myself from the fire that I’m spitting bitch
But back on topic – government is watching –
Republicans and democrats are tryna feed us toxin
I try to send my demo raps but nobody will watch em'
I’ll probably never reach my dreams before I reach the coffin cause
This is America
This is America
Fucking America
Better be ware of the
Better be ware of the
