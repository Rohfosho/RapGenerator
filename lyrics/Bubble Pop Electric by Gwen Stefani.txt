[Intro: Johnny Vulture & Gwen Stefani]
[Gwen Stefani:]
C'mon, Johnny! When you're gonna get here?
Alright, hold your pretty horses, I'll be there in a minute
You just get yourself dolled up, alright Tootsie?
You pick a place! You just pick a place!
Um, Johnny?
Yeah, Gwennie-Gwen-GWEN?
You might wanna hurry
Because tonight, is the night

I'm empty, I need fulfilling, yes I do love, a-to the ceiling
When I do love, I get this feeling when I'm in love...
I'm restless, Can't you see I try my bestest?
To be [a] good girl, because it's just us so take me now, and do me justice
I'm waiting, a-patiently anticipating, your arrival
And I'm hating, it takes so long to get to my house, to take me out

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gonna give you all my looooove in the back seat
Bubble, Pop, Elec-tric; Bubble, Pop, Elec-tric
Gonna speed it down and slow it uuuuuuup in the backseat
Bubble, Pop, Elec-tric; Uh-oh! In the backseat

Okay now, I understand he's on his way now, but jeez Louise, I mean today now!
I can't wait, I wanna play, now!
I'm antsy, Bubble Pop Electric pansies, my sweet tooth, I want your candy
The Queen of Eng would say it, randy (*laughs*)
I'm itchy; I wish you would come and scratch me
Tonight I'm falling, won't you catch me? Swoop on by so you can snatch me and take me out

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[*doorbell rings*]

Hey Johnny! Lemme go grab my sweater
Hi, Mrs. Stefani
Bye, mom
So, baby where you wanna go, huh?

[Break 2X]
Bubble Pop Electric, you've gotta get it (Straight to me, drive-in movie)
Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet (Come to me, drive-in movie)

[Hook]

Yeah, tell your father, I said 'ello!
Johnny, get outta here!
