I know

You wanna go

I know-ow

You wanna go

Come on, we taking off

And I know you don't wanna miss this plane



Started with 100 bricks

Now I sold out bitch

My mama says stay patient

Hunnid bands I ain't waiting

I'm figgity figgity fucked up

Boy you got me fucked up

I'm figgity figgity fucked up

God damn you got me fucked up



Fill my cup up then you got me fucked up

Every ugly bitch in here, they looking bad as fuck

She popped a molly (OH!) Look at her tongue

The bitch that came with me said they want some

Just look at that, Forest, look at that, Forest, run!

Got pink in my cup, it's not lookin' like just a Bubble Gum

I'm asking the bitch "what's her name?" she telling me Cinnamon

I want to put all my glaze on you like a Cinnabon





Lil' mama be looking so gorgeous

She ask me can I afford it

I told her bitch she got me fucked up

My Migos chain can pay her mortgage

24k on my toilet

Pockets enormous calling me Norbit

Take it from Migos I'm making Tostitos, illegal, I might get deported

You niggas be trippin, you fucked up

If you thinkin' you gon' catch me slipping

(KLA! KLA! KLA!)

Leaving no witness, Grinch comin' through your chimney

I got the Bobby, the Britney, the Iggy

Sorry I ran out of Whitney

Yeah nigga, I'm making history

Before I die, you gon' remember me





She grindin' her teeth like she hungry

Poppin' the molly, she horny

She talkin' too much, she annoying

She giving out blowjobs, no employment

My diamonds anemic, she sneaking and geeking

She said she got a nigga, tell him she cheatin'

It's been a whole weekend, so when are you leaving?

Just suck on the dick baby girl, don't be teasing

My neck is so sick, somebody come and treat it

Migos in the building and we sold out arenas

Come get yo bitch 'out the system my nigga

She smokin' up all of the reefer

Leave my 2 liter, don't do margaritas

This shit that we're smokin' is louder than speakers
