(Do that shit)



Every couple summers, me and a couple hunters

Like to row in from the isle of astonishing motherfuckers



Machines cleaner than three marines mothers rooms

Came in peace but leaving with keys to your VW



Needle-nosed pliers and a paragon of level design

These are the weapons of bedeviling times

If the medicine chest temper like a towny come untethered

To a busker with a twenty minute "Downeaster Alexa" cover



I didn't start the fire but I plan to

Dance around it naked with pagans, leggings, and pan-flutes

Shampoo, hairspray, hustler friends

Eat shit, die like it's just for men



Most illinest, toast the mutineer of the year

I'm a bum, my motherfucking beard has a beard



Hot stepper, leper with measurements all wrong

I'm a beast, my motherfucking dog got a dog



I'm sorry, deeper in the polygons

Radical brats compare teeth on the promenade

Mans worst friend, tragedy prone

Skirting a neverending exodus from Madame Tussauds

He's an immediate threat, speaking nefarious tongues

Reeking of variant faith, drinking that heresy punch

I play defender at the center for the never enough

You called it losing my way, I called it leveling up



Up up ante, Danny riding through the west wing

Big wheel bloody, fuzzy images of dead twins

Cuff links, button-up, sloppy coat, no hat

Satan's mother, twisted sister, brothers Grimm and ghost dad

Number six throwback, Mickey Mantle Upper Deck

Jackknife pegasus to basic bitches rubberneck

Pinky swear, bible belt, o-ring on his spider bite

Flat rate to the city if you iffy gypsies ride or die



Salt in his wounds (check) Rice in his stomach (check)

Price on his head (check) Lice in his mullet (check)



Head on a stake, feet gracing the ottoman

Sweaty bandanna, come meet the amazing Jonathan



Hi Jonathan, meet the amazing Hollow Man

Turn a snow globe into a lava lamp

Backyard, black marshmallows on his olive branch

Dressed up like an evil villain dressed up like a soccer dad



Mallon, we don't plan it

Skull tats, banshee bunk in a bone hammock

Drunk from its own damage, sell 'cuz it's well made

Ducks that are both sitting and standing at Hells gate



Girl, you smell great
