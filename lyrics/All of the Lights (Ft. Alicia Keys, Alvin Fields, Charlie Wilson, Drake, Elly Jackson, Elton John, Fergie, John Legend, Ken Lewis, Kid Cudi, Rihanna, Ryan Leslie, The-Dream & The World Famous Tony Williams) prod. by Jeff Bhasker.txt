[Hook: Rihanna]
All of the lights, all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Elly Jackson]
Fast cars, shooting stars
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
Cop lights, flash lights
Spot lights, strobe lights
Street lights
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook]

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Verse 3: Fergie]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, Okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Hook: Choir]

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Elton John]
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh
I tried to tell you but all I could say
