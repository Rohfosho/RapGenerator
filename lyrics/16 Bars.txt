All you niggas better leave the fuckin state, no need to masturbate

Fuckin with Biggie, it's time to castrate.. it's clobberin time

When I rip rhymes I quench thirsts like Very Fine

And I'm still thirsty - niggas wanna hurt the six-pack maniac

Coke, tecs, and macs black

Check the stacks, what the fuck?

I throw uppercuts like Riddick Bowe

And I'm wicked with the slow-flow, y'know?

I'm pressin hard, I'm leavin creases

Cuttin up bodies and talkin to the pieces

If there's beef, I'm eatin meatless

Touch the bone, hit the dome, Al Capone

Get stoned off the blunt when it's filled with the skunk

Get drunk, and do a demolition to punk

And all chumps, that scream that my shit don't thump

They catch lumps and bumps, I'll put a shake in your rump
