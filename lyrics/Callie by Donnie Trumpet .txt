Yeah, uh

All my peoples around the world

Flame up to this shit



She number one

She always knows me

When to chill or when to roll a blunt up

When I'm lonely

That she never trippin'

If I'm tryin' to kick it with the homies

That she always givin' even if it's her weed

That we'd be smokin'

She keep me high

I be chilling in the shade like Stevie eye

Smoking in the whip like a DUI

Never coming down no ETI

Feeling like a Beastie Boy

Smokin on that yolk ?

? took a head shot

Mama told me not to roll up in the house

So we took it to the park

Where a nigga' could spark

Those days were so forgetful

Runaway my memories

Only that killer weed was disrespectful

Like I said we were rolling A's

Twisting on them now

We do no boo boo gray ?

What's that nigga' you got going round

If it was one in the morning now?

Wished that every day

I'm in love with Mary Jane

Every bad bitch just keeps me blazed

I guess it was meant to be

Cause ? is my destiny

Lies and life's complexities

Got to thank the lord for blessing me with you



Callie and Kush

Callie baby

You're the one for me

And Callie baby your the one for me



She's sugar coated too sweet

Deserved the cover of Newsweek

Delivered the word from looseleaf

Flew to me like a hoop dream

To close to the stars

Sugar star

She's to close to the art

We to close to the star

Supposed to be smart

Close still far

So sugar for show for sure

I say sugar for show for sure

Sugar for show sure

I'll never be to far

My little amour

Cherie amour

For what we have in store

Is for why I'm in it for

My galaxy forever more

Quote "The Raven" I'm safe in saying

Never more

Grassroots we pave

In case footing gets grave

Take five onto a wave ?

Ride out onto the wave

The way I ascended onto you

I do

I pretend it's on you

But understand

Don't underestimate this man

Blame it on the music

Not the callie and kush
