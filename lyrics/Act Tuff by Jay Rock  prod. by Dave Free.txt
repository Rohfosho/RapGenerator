Jay Rock, K. Dot

Watts City finest, and the Hub City threat

LB I see you my nigga

Let's go



I'm trying to get cash, quick fast

With past of Trinidad

When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats

I would have swallowed that

Nickerson Garden projects gain the profit

Of my lyrical content

Build a monument

Gotta put a clip to your conscience

Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift

Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit

The spliff lit, when I'm high can't I spit sick

Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier

With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover

And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers

When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers



You wanna act tough

Let's see if you really are, when this gun busts

Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go

Queen of drama, that's on my momma

You don't wanna rumble

Jay Rock I'll put you under

(You wanna act tough

Let me see if you really are, when this gun busts

Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go

Queen of drama, that's on my momma

You don't wanna rumble

K. Dot will put you under)



Since VapoRubs mom's got my Nyquizzle

I was just a scrub now it's all about the bizzles

Trying to make a buck slinging weed and E pizzles

I'll eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle

Get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle

The other on the clutch,  my middle finger up

Shit I'm not giving a fuck

Catch me on Rosecrans and Central leanin' like I'm supposed to

My brain is mental I never stay focused

Plus I'm in the hood with the hood rats and roaches

Caught crack, now served a three-fifth on my culture

Acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster





I ain't running, I'ma stand my ground

I'ma keep on gunning

My momma never raised a punk, nigga I ain't a chump

You disrespect you'll be on my thump

Ghetto kill, make you lift up

You don't wanna get struck

Like a match, got a back

I attack with a Mac, that'll tear your shit up

Now the paramedics gotta come and make that pick up

Dog, I hit your block in a pick-up

I do it by myself, with a hook and an uppercut

Doctor got a six, what, nigga are you real or what

I'm a little guy but I'm tough

I hit hard then I'm natural

You a dead man when my gat bust

If you running nigga better run a little faster
